The goal of this study was to identify genetic determinants of hepatic lipid accumulation through association analysis using histological phenotypes in obese individuals. Using the Illumina HumanOmniExpress BeadChip assay, we genotyped 2300 individuals on whom liver biopsy data were available. We analyzed total bilirubin levels, which are linked to fatty liver in severe obesity, and observed the strongest evidence for association with rs4148325 in UGT1A (P<5.0 x 10-93), replicating previous findings. We assessed hepatic fat level and found strong evidence for association with rs4823173, rs2896019, and rs2281135, all located in PNPLA3 and rs10401969 in SUGP1. Analysis of liver transcript levels of 20 genes residing at the SUGP1/NCAN locus identified a 1.6-fold change in expression of the LPAR2 gene in fatty liver.

We then extended this approach to histologically determined hepatic lipid content as a phenotype. To minimize the effect of genetic variants that predispose to severe fat accumulation, we also conducted genome-wide analysis of mild or incipient hepatic lipid accumulation, which may have more relevance to the onset of hepatic insulin resistance.

SOCS2 has also been shown to regulate proinsulin processing and insulin secretion in pancreatic beta cells, potentially linking fatty liver susceptibility and insulin resistance. In a morbidly obese cohort of women, similar to the one studied here, SOCS2 gene expression was decreased in liver RNA relative to patients who had lost a substantial amount of weight. Our findings of reduced SOCS2 expression in fatty compared to normal liver are concordant with these findings.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 27747, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "We also identified an association with low grade hepatic fat with a SNP nearby the RAMP3 gene, which encodes a receptor activity modifying protein for the islet amyloid polypeptide (amylin) receptor. Amylin is a small peptide hormone expressed primarily by pancreatic islet beta cells. Amylin improves the effect of leptin on insulin sensitivity in leptin-resistant diet-induced obese mice and has been shown to regulate fatty acid sterification in cultured adipocytes. The interaction of SOCS2 and RAMP3 genotypes, coupled with the available biological information, adds further evidence to support their role in mild hepatic fat accumulation.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 28392, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Despite the significance of the findings reported here, we acknowledge several limitations. First, this study is comprised solely of individuals with extreme levels of obesity. The pathophysiology of hepatic lipid accumulation may be different in these extreme levels of obesity. In regard to this potential limitation, however, two considerations are worth noting: 1) in our observations, the mean BMI at each successive grade of hepatic fat was similar, and 2) obtaining liver tissue from individuals without clinical indication, i.e., healthy subjects, presents a significant ethical challenge, given the potential morbidity and mortality associated with the procedure. Similarly, another potential limitation of this proposal is the relative uniformity of the study population, which is primarily of Caucasian ethnicity and largely represents a single institutional, retrospective design. The population is also over 80% female, which may also limit generalizability, although sex-specific analyses suggest that the PNPLA3 locus may exhibit a higher degree of association in women than men. Our ability to detect significant associations was limited by the relatively small sample size for a GWAS. Unfortunately, large data sets of histologically based phenotypes for studies of human liver are difficult to accrue. Despite this limitation, we had sufficient power to replicate several associations at stringent statistical significance thresholds, largely due to the large effect sizes of the variants, e.g., those associated with total bilirubin and the PNPLA3 SNPs. For subgroup analysis of incipient fat accumulation, which reduced the sample size, we estimated that we could detect a genotypic relative risk of about 1.3 with 80% power and a type I error rate of 0.05 given a risk allele frequency of 0.05 (e.g., the RAMP3 SNP) and a prevalence of fatty liver of 0.62.
