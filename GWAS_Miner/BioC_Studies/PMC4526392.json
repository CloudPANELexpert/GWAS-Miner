A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in an enhancer in the MGMT promoter was previously identified to be highly significantly associated with risk for MGMT methylation in lung cancer and sputum from smokers. To further genetic investigations, a genome-wide association and replication study was conducted in two smoker cohorts to identify novel loci for MGMT methylation in sputum that were independent of the MGMT enhancer polymorphism. Two novel trans-acting loci (15q15.2 and 17q24.3) that were identified acted together with the enhancer SNP to empower risk prediction for MGMT methylation. We found that the predisposition to MGMT methylation arising from the 15q15.2 locus involved regulation of the ubiquitin protein ligase E3 component UBR1. UBR1 attenuation reduced turnover of MGMT protein and increased repair of O6-methylguanine in nitrosomethylurea-treated human bronchial epithelial cells (HBEC), while also reducing MGMT promoter activity and abolishing MGMT induction. Overall, our results substantiate reduced gene transcription as a major mechanism for predisposition to MGMT methylation in the lungs of smokers, and support the importance of UBR1 in regulating MGMT homeostasis and DNA repair of alkylated DNA adducts in cells.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 1578, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "Introduction", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 1591, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) is a DNA repair enzyme that protects cells from carcinogenic effects of alkylating agents by removing adducts from the O6 position of guanine.

The irreversible binding of the alkyl group to the MGMT protein functionally inactivates the enzyme and leads to a structural alteration resulting in the recognition by ubiquitin ligases and degradation by the proteasome.

Although alkylating adducts such as O6MG can be derived from endogenous methylation by S- adenosylmethionine, knockouts of MGMT failed to show enhanced tumor formation unless treated with exogenous alkylating carcinogens.

Concomitant methylation of a panel of cancer-relevant genes including MGMT detected in lung epithelial cells present in sputum predicts risk for subsequent lung cancer incidence in moderate and heavy smokers.

The ratio of naive versus suicide MGMT decreased with increasing concentrations of MNU treatment with almost no active MGMT left at the highest MNU concentration (not shown). Interestingly, without MNU treatment, protease V8 cutting is still detected supporting formation of endogenous alkylating DNA adducts as a part of normal cellular metabolism in these cells, although the assay specificity for detecting suicide MGMT may not be perfect due to its potential binding to other proteins. The ratio of naive versus suicide MGMT was higher in control HBECs compared to UBR1 KD lines (0.95 vs 0.71, paired ttest p=0.037, Figure 1b) with the largest difference seen in HBEC26 (0.36, Figure 1c), suggesting accumulation of suicide MGMT in UBR1 KD lines. UBR1 knockout cells are resistant to alkylating agent (MNNG) induced genotoxicity probably because UBR1 targets both alkylated and unmodified MGMT.

Ontology classification of genes (n=115) in the region of the proximal CpG sites mediating the trans-acting associations identified GTPase activity related genes, genes regulating transcription, and genetic imprinting as the top three categories involved in DNA methylation regulation. A unique mechanism underlying the predisposition of MGMT methylation in lungs of smokers involving the regulation of UBR1 expression by rs16957091 within the chromosome 15q15.2 locus was elucidated (Figure 5). Because reduced gene transcription is a major mechanism predisposing MGMT for promoter hypermethylation in multiple tissue types, three HBEC lines with stable UBR1 KD were established to assess whether reduced UBR1 expression could affect the MGMT transcription. The functional validity of UBR1 KD was confirmed by showing compromised degradation of suicide MGMT or unmodified MGMT and increased DNA repair towards MNU induced O6MG in UBR1 KD lines compared to control HBECs. These effects by UBR1 are consistent with its role of binding to the internal degrons of suicide MGMT protein and even unmodified MGMT for subsequent degradation via the 26S proteasome in eukaryotes. In addition, greater DNA repair towards O6MG in UBR1 KD lines may be due to the accumulation of unmodified MGMT resulting from UBR1 KD. More importantly, stable UBR1 KD reduced MGMT promoter activity and abolished the induction of MGMT expression in HBEC models treated with non-cytotoxic MNU. These findings suggest that compromised MGMT degradation may not be able to provide an efficient positive feedback to the MGMT transcriptional machinery under normal physiological conditions or in response to alkylating agent exposure.
