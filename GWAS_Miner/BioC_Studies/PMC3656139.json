Little is known about the genes influencing its levels directly or through glomerular filtration rate (GFR). We conducted a genome-wide association study of plasma B2M levels in 6738 European Americans from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study to identify novel loci for B2M and assessed its association with known estimated GFR (eGFR) loci. We identified 2 genome-wide significant loci. One was in the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) region on chromosome 6 (lowest p-value=1.8x10-23 for rs9264638). At this locus, 6 index SNPs accounted for 3.2% of log(B2M) variance, and their association with B2M could largely be explained by imputed classical alleles of the MHC class I genes: HLA-A, HLA-B, or HLA-C. The index SNPs at this locus were not associated with eGFR based on serum creatinine (eGFRcr). The other locus of B2M was on chromosome 12 (rs3184504 at SH2B3, beta=0.02, p-value=3.1x10-8), which was previously implicated as an eGFR locus. In conclusion, although B2M is known to be a component of MHC class I molecule, the association between HLA class I alleles and plasma B2M levels in a community-based population is novel.

Our study was the first GWAS of B2M and had a large representative sample of European Americans. Confounding with population stratification was controlled using principal components. B2M levels were measured centrally with a high reliability coefficient (0.98), thus reducing heterogeneity of the phenotype. Nonetheless, the results should be interpreted with a few limitations. First, the two genome-wide significant loci of B2M have not been replicated in other population-based cohorts. However, the B2M's role as a component of the MHC class I molecule supports the statistical association of B2M levels and HLA class I variants in a population-based cohort. The statistical association was highly robust (p<10-21). The SH2B3 locus was previously shown to be associated with eGFRcr and eGFRcys, suggesting a common mechanism for the association of a third filtration marker, B2M. The association analyses of the imputed HLA classical alleles were based on most likely genotype calls. However, these imputed HLA classical alleles had high posterior probabilities with a median of over 0.99. Finally, the associations of B2M with known eGFR loci were assessed without a GFR estimation equation for B2M which could have improved the ability to control for non-kidney function influencing B2M levels. In addition, pathological implications of the HLA variants associated with higher B2M remain unclear. Additional studies examining the relation between the B2M-associated HLA variants and phenotypes known to be associated with B2M levels, such as peripheral arterial disease, multiple myeloma and dialysis-related amyloidosis will be important for determining whether the variants are causal for these conditions.
