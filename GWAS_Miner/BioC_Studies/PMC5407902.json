Methadone is used to treat opioid dependence (OD), acting as a selective agonist at the mu-opioid receptor encoded by the gene OPRM1. Determining the optimal methadone maintenance dose is time-consuming; currently, no biomarkers are available to guide treatment. In methadone-treated OD subjects drawn from a case and control sample, we conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of usual daily methadone dose. In African-American (AA) OD subjects (n = 383), we identified a genome-wide significant association between therapeutic methadone dose (mean = 68.0 mg, standard deviation (SD) = 30.1 mg) and rs73568641 (P = 2.8 x 10-8), the nearest gene (306 kilobases) being OPRM1. Each minor (C) allele corresponded to an additional ~20 mg/day of oral methadone, an effect specific to AAs.
