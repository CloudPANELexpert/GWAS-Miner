The genetic basis of AA is largely unknown. We undertook a genome-wide association study (GWAS) in a sample of 1,054 cases and 3,278 controls and identified 139 single nucleotide polymorphisms that are significantly associated with AA (P <= 5 x 10-7). Here we show an association with genomic regions containing several genes controlling the activation and proliferation of regulatory T cells (Treg cells), cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA4), interleukin (IL)-2/IL-21, IL-2 receptor A (IL-2RA; CD25) and Eos (also known as Ikaros family zinc finger 4; IKZF4), as well as the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) region. We also find association evidence for regions containing genes expressed in the hair follicle itself (PRDX5 and STX17). A region of strong association resides within the ULBP (cytomegalovirus UL16-binding protein) gene cluster on chromosome 6q25.1, encoding activating ligands of the natural killer cell receptor NKG2D that have not previously been implicated in an autoimmune disease. By probing the role of ULBP3 in disease pathogenesis, we also show that its expression in lesional scalp from patients with AA is markedly upregulated in the hair follicle dermal sheath during active disease. This study provides evidence for the involvement of both innate and acquired immunity in the pathogenesis of AA. We have defined the genetic underpinnings of AA, placing it within the context of shared pathways among autoimmune diseases, and implicating a novel disease mechanism, the upregulation of ULBP ligands, in triggering autoimmunity.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 1877, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "AA affects about 5.3 million people in the United States alone, including males and females across all ethnic groups, with a lifetime risk of 1.7% (refs). Autoimmunity develops against the hair follicle, resulting in non-scarring hair loss that may begin as patches that can coalesce and progress to cover the entire scalp (alopecia totalis) or eventually the entire body (alopecia universalis) (Supplementary Fig. 1). The phenomenon of 'sudden whitening of the hair' is ascribed to the acute onset of AA at times of profound grief, stress or fear, in which the pigmented hair is selectively shed while the white hair persists. AA spares the stem cell compartment and attacks only the base of the hair follicle, which is surrounded by infiltrating lymphocytes. Despite these marked perturbations in the hair follicle, there is no permanent organ destruction, and regrowth of the hair remains possible. The concept of an autoimmune mechanism as the basis for AA emerged during the twentieth century from multiple lines of evidence. AA hair follicles are surrounded by an immune infiltrate with activated T-helper cells (TH cells), cytotoxic T cells (TC cells) and natural killer (NK) cells, characterized as a TH1-type inflammatory response.

Each of the ULBP genes has been shown to function as an NKG2D-activating ligand.

It has been postulated that NKG2D ligands, if overexpressed in genetically susceptible individuals, can trigger an autoimmune response against the tissue expressing the ligand. To probe this hypothesis in the setting of AA, we examined ULBP3 expression within the hair follicle of unaffected scalp (Fig. 3a, b) and patients with AA (Fig. 3c, d). Whereas ULBP3 is expressed at low levels within the dermal papilla in normal hair follicle (Fig. 3a, b), in two different patients with early active AA lesions, we observed marked upregulation of ULBP3 expression in the dermal sheath as well as the dermal papilla (Fig. 3c, d), but not in control individuals or those with other inflammatory scalp disorders (data not shown). Quantitative immunohistochemistry corroborated a significantly increased number of ULBP3+ cells in 16 additional AA samples (Fig. 3p). We also noted a massive inflammatory cell infiltrate characterized by CD8+CD3+ T cells (Fig. 3g-l), but only rare NK cells (data not shown). Double immunostaining with an anti-CD8 and an anti-NKG2D antibody revealed that most NKG2D+ cells were CD8+ T cells (Fig. 3m-o). These results suggest that the autoimmune destruction in AA may be mediated in part by CD8+NKG2D+ cytotoxic T cells, whose activation may be induced by upregulation of ULBP3 in the dermal sheath of the hair follicle.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 8262, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The localization of an NK-activating ligand in the outermost layer of the hair follicle places it in an ideal position to express a danger signal and engage NKG2D on immune cells in the local milieu. Inducible overexpression of the ULBP homologues Rae1epsilon and Rae1alpha in mouse epidermis and pulmonary epithelium were previously shown to markedly alter the immune microenvironment within the skin and lung, respectively. We postulate that in genetically susceptible individuals, upregulation of ULBP3 may have a similar effect on initiating the immune response in AA, and/or may become induced as part of an inflammatory cascade. Consistent with these findings, upregulation of the NK ligand MICA has recently been demonstrated in the hair follicle of patients with AA. Taken together with the increased numbers of perifollicular NKG2D+CD8+ cells that we and others observed in lesional skin of patients with AA (Fig. 3), these data implicate a mechanism involving the expression of NKG2D ligands, including ULBPs, and infiltration of NKG2D-expressing cells in the aetiology of AA.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 9349, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "In addition to ULBP3/ULBP6, we identified other genes that are expressed in the hair follicle and may provide insight into the initiating events (Supplementary Figs 3 and 4). For example, STX17 (rs10760706, P = 3.60 x 10-7) is expressed in the hair follicle and is associated with the grey hair phenotype in horses, which is of interest because AA preferentially attacks pigmented hairs. PRDX5 (rs694739, P = 4.14 x 10-7) is an antioxidant enzyme involved in the cellular response to oxidative stress, a process which is dysregulated in AA scalp. PRDX5 has been implicated in the degeneration of target cells in several autoimmune disorders, and other PRDX family members can serve as autoantigens (Supplementary Table 7).

We found strong evidence for genes involved in the differentiation and maintenance of both immunosuppressive Treg cells, as well as their functional antagonists, pro-inflammatory T helper cells (TH17). Treg cells have a critical function in preventing immune responses against autoantigens, and their differentiation depends on the early expression of IL-2RA (CD25) (rs3118470, P = 1.74 x 10-12), as well as a key lineage-determining transcription factor, Foxp3. Foxp3-mediated gene silencing is critical in determining that Treg cells effectively suppress immune responses. Both IL-2 (rs7682241, P = 4.27 x 10-8) and its high-affinity receptor IL-2RA (rs3118470, P = 1.74 x 10-12) are central in controlling the survival and proliferation of Treg cells. It was recently found that Eos (IKZF4) (rs1701704, P = 3.21 x 10-8), a member of the Ikaros family of transcription factors, is a key co-regulator of FoxP3-directed gene silencing during Treg differentiation. Although Treg cells probably use several different mechanisms to suppress immune responses, the high expression of CTLA4 (rs1024161, P = 3.55 x 10-13) has been proposed as a major determinant of their suppressive activity, particularly because CTLA4 is essential for the inhibitory activity of Treg cells on antigen-presenting cells. The IL-2 locus is tightly linked with IL-21 (rs7682241, P = 4.27 x 10-8), which has pleiotropic effects on multiple cell lineages, including CD8+ T cells, B cells, NK cells and dendritic cells. IL-21 is a major product of proinflammatory TH17 (IL-17-producing CD4+ TH cells) and has been shown to have a key role in both promoting the differentiation of TH17 cells and limiting the differentiation of Treg cells.
