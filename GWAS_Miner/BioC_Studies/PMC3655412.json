For confirming thyroid cancer GWAS results for SNPs under investigation in the present study, we used the Centaurs genotyping platform (see Supplementary Note) to attempt genotyping all 572 samples available from affected individuals and a minimum of 1,500 unaffected individuals.

Briefly, the subjects were randomly selected and recruited as dense three-generation families as a part of a study on inheritance of gene expression in humans. Peripheral blood was collected and DNA and RNA extracted. The RNA samples were hybridized to a custom made microarray (Agilent Technologies). The correlation between the mean logarithm (log10) expression ratio (MLR) of NRG1, measured using RNA from whole blood of 966 individuals, and genotypes of relevant SNP(s), was tested by regressing the MLRs on the number of copies of the at-risk alleles. The effect of age, gender and differential cell counts was taken into account by including corresponding terms as an explanatory variable in the regression analysis. All P values were adjusted for relatedness of the individuals by dividing the chi-square statistics by an adjustment factor of 1.064, determined through simulations. The probe used to test the expression of NRG1 is located on 8p12 at the position chr. 8:32741415-32741475 in NCBI build 36. The total expression data set is available from the GEO database (see accession code listings above).", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 22770, "infons": {"section_type": "METHODS", "type": "title_2"}, "text": "Genotyping", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 22781, "infons": {"section_type": "METHODS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The Icelandic chip-typed samples were assayed using the Illumina BeadChips at deCODE genetics.
