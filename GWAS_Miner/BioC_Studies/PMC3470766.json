We performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) for disordered gambling using a quantitative factor score in 1,312 twins from 894 Australian families. Association was conducted for 2,381,914 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) using the family-based association test in Merlin followed by gene and pathway enrichment analyses. Although no SNP reached genome-wide significance, six achieved P-values < 1 x 10-5 with variants in three genes (MT1X, ATXN1 and VLDLR) implicated in disordered gambling. Secondary case-control analyses found two SNPs on chromosome 9 (rs1106076 and rs12305135 near VLDLR) and rs10812227 near FZD10 on chromosome 12 to be significantly associated with lifetime DSM-IV pathological gambling and SOGS classified probable pathological gambling status. Furthermore, several addiction-related pathways were enriched for SNPs associated with disordered gambling. Finally, gene-based analysis of 24 candidate genes for dopamine agonist induced gambling in individuals with Parkinson's disease suggested an enrichment of SNPs associated with disordered gambling. We report the first GWAS of disordered gambling.

This is because even though very few individuals in a community-based sample will exceed the diagnostic threshold for a DG diagnosis many will provide valuable information about individual differences along the broader DG continuum. Previous studies that treated all individuals unaffected with DG disorder as being equivalent may have had considerable heterogeneity in their samples of unaffected controls. Recognizing the variation below the diagnostic threshold can turn this potential liability into an asset.

There is also evidence that ATXN1 is involved in alcohol dependence where ATXN1 expression is down-regulated in post-mortem frontal and motor cortices of human alcoholics and in successful smoking cessation. ATXN1 has also been shown to occupy the dopamine 2 receptor (DRD2) promoter in vivo and to regulate DRD2 gene expression in Purkinje cells of the cerebellum in mice.

We therefore proceeded to the pathway analysis, which is able to mine a wider range of association results by testing for over-representation of genes within pre-defined pathways without restricting the search to 'significant' SNPs.

Three pathways (synaptic long term potentiation, synaptic long term depression and GNRH signaling) have been previously implicated in aspects of alcohol and nicotine dependence and addiction to opioids and cocaine.

Third, the gene and pathway enrichment analyses are gene centric and do not include markers located in intergenic regions of the genome. A final feature, which could be considered either a strength or a limitation, is recruitment of subjects from the general population rather than a clinical source.
