This hypothesis, and the failure to observe a simple association for SNPs spanning the HLA region prompted us to look in more detail at the HLA region using fully imputed HLA alleles for HLA-A, -B, -C, -DP, -DQ, and -DR. We first compared imputed alleles at HLA-DRB1 with those determined directly by conventional DNA sequencing methods.

One of the most obvious reasons for a failure to produce alloantibodies during pregnancy is if both parents are matched at most or all HLA loci. Given the sheer diversity of HLA variation in this population, it would be rare statistically for spouses to share many HLA alleles, and there are compelling data to indicate that some degree of disassortative mating occurs in humans for HLA variants, such that spouses are mismatched even beyond what is expected on the basis of allele frequencies in the population. The degree of HLA discordance between mother and spouse did not differ between women who were or were not alloimmunized (Table 4A). However, women who developed HLA class I antibodies showed a trend to a higher degree of HLA mismatch with their children than non-alloimmunized women, and for development of HLA class II antibodies, those who were alloimmunized were significantly more mismatched with their progeny (Figure 3, Table 4B).

Members of this gene family were first described in the context of neural signaling, but are expressed widely and probably have functions well beyond the neural system. Neurexophilins are secreted and have been described as detectable in plasma; and a member of the same family, NXPH1, has been shown to influence growth of hematopoietic progenitor cells. In a preliminary GWAS using sliding windows, a SNP within NXPH2 has been associated with rheumatoid arthritis. SNPs in NXPH2 have also be associated with male infertility and alcohol dependency. Given the large effect size of variation in the NXPH2 gene on the risk for alloimmunization and its known role in cell signaling in the neural system, it is plausible that this protein would have an effect on the immune system and the propensity to develop alloantibodies. A parallel example is found in neuropilin-1, which is important for axon guidance but also has been identified as an important marker of regulatory T cells. Neurexophilins are known to bind to neurexins and other ligands, and NXPH1 has been shown to bind to and influence the growth of hematopoietic progenitor cells. Whether or not NXPH2 can interact with cells of the immune system has not yet been studied, but our genetic association data and the prior literature suggests that such an interaction is possible. The implicated SNPs within NXPH2 are contained in the midst of a single, long intron. How the SNPs are related to the effect on alloimmunization is potentially via modulation of expression of NXPH2 or other mechanisms dependent on intragenic sequence such as long, noncoding RNA (lncRNA) modulation of neighboring genes.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 17775, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "While the minor allele variant of NXPH2 appeared to confer a modest to strong increased risk for the development of HLA class I antibodies in pregnancy [Odds Ratio (OR) = 1.96], there was no association between NXPH2 SNPs and the risk of becoming sensitized to HLA class II antibodies. If this finding were to be confirmed, it would help design further studies about the pathway of allosensitization during pregnancy and for the identification of candidate genes that are necessary for the responder status. From epidemiologic studies of pregnant women it is known that of those who become alloimmunized, nearly equal proportions will develop antibodies against HLA class I antigens only, class II antigens only, or both class I and II antigens, with the last category slightly less common than the first two. Why women develop class I versus II allosensitization is not clear, though it is known that there is differential regulation of expression of these antigens on fetal cells. The fetal cell with the most direct exposure to the maternal immune system is the trophoblast. In these cells HLA class II expression is suppressed due to lack of class II transactivator (CIITA) expression that is mediated via methylation of the CIITA interferon-gamma-responsive promoter (PIV). Trophoblasts also lack expression of most HLA class I molecules, with exception of the non-classical molecules HLA-C, HLA-E, and HLA-G. It is possible that NXPH2 could interact differentially with the epigenetic pathways that silence HLA class I versus class II molecules in trophoblasts. In addition to direct exposure to trophoblasts, fetal DNA and cells can be detected in maternal circulation during gestation. Finally, a major potential source of fetal interaction with maternal blood is during parturition. For these last two routes of exposure, most of the cells that would be seen by the maternal immune system would express HLA class I but not class II, with the exception of professional antigen presenting cells (APCs).
