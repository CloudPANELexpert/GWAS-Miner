Additionally of interest, a limb specific regulatory element located 110 kb downstream of BMP2 is mutated in brachydactyly type A2. Therefore, we predict that a skull-specific BMP2 regulatory element is located within or near the association region. Also, non-coding SNPs can affect gene expression variation of one or many genes.

BBS9 is a component of the multiprotein complex BBSome which plays critical roles in intraflagellar transport, or moving cargo molecules in and out of cilia. Loss-of-function mutations in BBS9 have been found in patients with Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS). BBS arises from defects of primary cilia that function as a platform for many important signaling events involving at least PDGFRalpha, hedgehog, epidermal growth factor, and 5-HT6 serotonin receptor. Although BBS does not present with suture phenotypes, it presents with a skeletal phenotype (polydactyly) and orofacial anomalies. It is noteworthy that aberrant signaling of PDGFRalpha and epidermal growth factor or hedgehog has been implicated in craniofacial development. In addition, it has been shown that FGF-signaling regulates cilia length and function during development of zebrafish and Xenopus. Thus, it is possible that CS-causing FGFR gain-of-function mutations also work via aberrant assembly and/or signaling of cilia. It remains to be seen whether gain-of-function mutations or overexpression of BBS9 would influence suture fusion. Three of the genes in the vicinity of the association on chromosome 7 (RP9P, KBTBD2, FKBP9) are pseudogenes and the remaining two, RP9 and NT5C3, have no known role in skeletal development and cause retinitis pigmentosa and hemolytic anemia, respectively.
