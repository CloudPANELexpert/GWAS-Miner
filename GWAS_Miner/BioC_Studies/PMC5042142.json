With the rise of multi-drug resistant M. tuberculosis strains and in the absence of an efficacious vaccine, TB remains a major public-health problem worldwide. One-third of the world's population is exposed to M. tuberculosis, and after exposure, most, individuals become infected, with around 10 % of infected individuals who develop clinical disease. Around half of these patients, particularly young children, develop \"primary\" TB, often associated with extra-pulmonary disease, within 2 years of infection. The other half of affected individuals develop clinical TB later in life, typically pulmonary TB (PTB) due to reactivation of the original infection, or in some cases, a novel infectious episode. In addition to environmental (e.g., microbial) and nongenetic (e.g., acquired immunodeficiency) host factors, there is emerging molecular evidence suggesting that human genetics contributes to the variability in response to M. tuberculosis. This is the case for the control of TB infection and of childhood TB with the discovery of singlegene inborn errors of IFN-gamma immunity. The study of genetic susceptibility to PTB has proven more difficult, although there is considerable evidence, particularly from twin studies, to support a major role for human genetic factors in the development of PTB. Candidate gene association studies investigating PTB resulted in the identification of a number of common associated variants.

Genetic heterogeneity probably plays an important role, with different variants involved in different patients. Rare or even private causal variants are also likely to be implicated in driving disease risk. Finally, the phenotypic heterogeneity of TB-related traits is probably responsible for further difficulties in detecting underlying human genetic risk factors. In PTB, the most commonly used phenotype-defining characteristic is the presence of M. tuberculosis in the sputum of patients, regardless of the other clinical, microbiological and demographic criteria. This approach ignores the dynamic and idiosyncratic nature of PTB, the likelihood that different stages of this process result from different sets of genetic causal factors, and the possible impact of the M. tuberculosis strain and inoculum on clinical outcomes. The extended natural history of M. tuberculosis infection and pathogenesis, involving a latency period that can last up to decades, complicates the interpretation of results, as PTB cases may either be reinfection or reactivation cases, such that in a given study population, pathogen variability over time as well as variability related to geography are considerations.
