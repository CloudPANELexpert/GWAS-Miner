Briefly, all imputed SNPs located within the interval 127.8 Mb to 128.8 on 8q24 were tested for possible incorporation into a multiple regression model. In stepwise fashion, a SNP was added to the model if it had the smallest P-value among all SNPs not yet included in the model and if it had a P-value below 1.5x10-9 (a GWAS significance threshold applicable according to a Bonferroni correction of 32 million tests). In the last step none of the SNPs remained significant at this threshold.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 19996, "infons": {"section_type": "METHODS", "type": "title_3"}, "text": "Inflation factor adjustment", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 20024, "infons": {"section_type": "METHODS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "In order to account for the relatedness and stratification within our case and control sample sets we applied the method of genomic control based on chip markers.

Shown are the corresponding numbers of cases and controls (n), allelic frequencies of variants in affected and control individuals, the allelic odds-ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (95% CI) and P value. Also shown are the P-values for the heterogeneity of the ORs (Phet) for all study groups as well as I2 which lies between 0% and 100% and describes the proportion of total variation in study estimates that is due to heterogeneity. For the combined study populations, the reported control frequency was the average, unweighted control frequency of the individual populations, while the OR and the P value were estimated using the Mantel-Haenszel model. Of the Icelandic cases, 2,315 patients had been genotyped using one of the Illumina chips, and 2,222 additional patients had at least partial data based on family based imputation. Of the Icelandic controls 27,780 were imputed based on chip-genotypes and 26,664 were family based imputed. All non-Icelandic replication samples are directly genotyped.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}], "annotations": [], "relations": []}]}
