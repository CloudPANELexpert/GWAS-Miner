In this study, the most associated SNPs in the initial GWAS for several glucose homeostasis and obesity traits have been followed with a 1536 SNP analysis in an expanded population sample of Hispanic-American ethnicity from San Antonio and San Luis Valley. Of these, there were four SNPs in two genes (at the P < 0.01 level for an additive model) that were contained in the 18 type 2 diabetes-associated genes as evaluated by GWAS in the IRAS FS sample. These two genes are THADA (thyroid adenoma associated [death receptor-interacting protein]; rs7595299) and CAMK1D (calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase ID; rs2768367, rs2399866, rs1004247) and appear to have a common pathway, involved in regulating the number of insulin-producing cells in the pancreas. The remaining 16 type 2 diabetes-associated genes as evaluated by GWAS were not associated with AIRg in the current study.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 22962, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "While the GWAS results in the IRAS FS Hispanic-American sample have provided interesting candidates for consideration, there are limitations to the interpretation of study results. First, as there are very few comparable studies with similarly defined phenotypes of beta cell response, the ability to replicate these findings is limited. Second, while the associations are ranked based upon rigorous statistical criteria, the admixture-adjusted P-values obtained do not meet genome-wide levels of significance (e.g., P < 5 x 10-7). Third, the effect sizes reflected in the genotypic means for each associated SNP average 25% of a standard deviation. In the full Hispanic-American sample of 1269 individuals for SNPs with MAF = 0.15, the power for this study to detect that effect size with type 1 error (P) of 10-3 and 10-4 are 89% and 71%, respectively. The power to detect a similar effect at a genome-wide level of significance is only 32%. Further examination of populations and correlated phenotypes for replication are needed.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 23996, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "In summary, a multistage GWAS for the acute insulin response to glucose (AIRg) - a measure of beta cell response - was performed in a Hispanic-American sample from the IRAS Family Study. Based upon these results, there are numerous SNPs and regions of the genome that may contain variants that account for common variation in AIRg. Two regions were interrogated with increased genotyping, and support was observed for a gene desert in chromosome 6p21 (containing PXT1, KCTD20 and STK38) and for several genes in chromosome 20p11 (ENTPD6, PYGB, GINS1 and RP4-691N24.1). The latter series of genes suggests a mechanism of action that could be involved in phosphorylation and ion transport. However, the power of the study is limited, the proportion of the observed heritability of AIRg explained by these genes is not substantial, and there is need for replication. In conclusion, several candidate genes have been identified as possibly contributing to variation in AIRg, a predictor of type 2 diabetes.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []},
