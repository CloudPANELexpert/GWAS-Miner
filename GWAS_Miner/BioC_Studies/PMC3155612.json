For our work presented here, the most promising novel candidate as a result of this study is rs2429917, located in the intron of SGSM2, or small G protein signaling modulator 2. SGSM2 is ubiquitously expressed in various tissues, including the liver, and as the name implies, acts as a modulator of G-protein signaling through its interaction with a subfamily of RAS proteins. Proteins involved in G protein-mediated signal transduction are associated with a number of cellular mechanisms, including differentiation and proliferation. It is also important to note that rs2429917 is located in a fairly gene-dense region of chromosome 17, including SMG6, SRR, TSR1, MNT, and METT10D, all within ~100 kb flanking SGSM2. Based on their biological functions, none of these neighboring genes are compelling candidates for association with lipid metabolism. However, SMG6 is an intriguing candidate given its essential association with telomerase activity and, thereby, aging. Deletion of Est1p (the S. cervisiae homolog to human SMG6) in yeast leads to ever-shorter telomeres over time despite functional telomerase activity. Telomere shortening occurs in all mitotic tissues (excluding germline tissue) as humans age and has been shown to contribute to mortality in many age-related diseases, including heart disease.
