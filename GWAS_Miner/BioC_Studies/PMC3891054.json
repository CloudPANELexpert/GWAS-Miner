After their initial synthesis, phospholipids such as phosphatidylglycerol undergo rapid deacylation-reacylation modeling (Lands' cycle) that alters the fatty acid present at their sn-2 position, which may influence phospholipid properties . Recent molecular studies suggest that the LPGAT1 protein preferentially transfers 16:0, 18:0, and 18:1n-9 to the sn-2 position of lysophosphatidylglycerol to generate phosphatidylglycerol, and thus contribute to the reacylation pathway . The novel genetic association observed in this study, as well as the growing evidence of the potentially important role of phosphatidylglycerol and phospholipid remodeling in cell signaling and metabolism , should encourage further research into genetic determinants of phosphatidylglycerol fatty acid composition and function.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 21895, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "We found 5 distinct loci associated with 16:1n-7, far more than for any of the other fatty acids evaluated. Because relatively few dietary sources of 16:1n-7 exist , metabolic factors may be particularly important in determining its circulating concentrations. Among the identified SNPs on chromosomes 2 and 10, GCKR and HIF1AN stand out as potential genes of interest. In GCKR, the T allele of rs780093 (the most significantly associated SNP with 16:1n-7) is in strong LD with the T allele of rs1260326 (r2=0.9), a non-synonymous variant (P446L) that has been consistently associated with elevated triglycerides and reduced fasting plasma glucose . GCKR encodes glucokinase regulatory protein, which inhibits the activity of glucokinase, a key protein with many roles including glucose sensing in liver and pancreas . Experimentally, P446L-GCKR has reduced inhibitory activity towards glucokinase, which would be predicted to increase glycolytic flux and production of malonyl-CoA, a key substrate for DNL pathway and triglyceride synthesis . Such genetically influenced increased availability of substrate for DNL might account for the observed association with 16:1n-7, a hypothesis that warrants testing in future investigations.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 23129, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "HIF1AN encodes a protein which modulates the activity of HIF-1alpha, a transcription factor regulating cellular metabolic responses to oxygen availability .

This protein has been suggested to function as a calcium-regulated non-selective cation channel with a role in detecting sour taste in humans . We are unaware of experimental studies suggesting its involvement in pathways related to 16:1n-7 or DNL. 16:1n-7 levels were also associated with several other SNPs in chromosome 10 genes, including NDUFB8 that encodes NADH dehydrogenase 1 beta sub-complex, SEC31B that encodes SEC31 homolog B, and WNT8B that encodes wingless-type MMTV integration site family member 8B. We could not identify prior studies suggesting a role of these genes in DNL or fatty acid metabolism. Further investigation of these potential effects may elucidate novel regulatory pathways and functions.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 24761, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Finally, we found a locus on chromosome 2 (top SNP: rs6722456) associated with 16:1n-7 that was not in close vicinity of known genes. The direction of association was consistent in 4 of 5 cohorts, but nevertheless the relevance of this finding is as yet unknown. A strength of this current analysis is that all of the participants in this consortium were from random subsets of cohorts, rather than nested case-controls studies, thus reducing the chance of selection bias. An additional strength of genetic studies such as this one is the absence of potential confounding from environmental or lifestyle factors. Our results were consistent across the cohorts, with minor heterogeneity present for InCHIANTI. We note that all other cohorts assessed fatty acids in plasma phospholipids, whereas fatty acids were measured in total plasma in InCHIANTI; this difference could, at least in part, account for some of this heterogeneity. We additionally confirmed the consistency of our results as exclusion of InCHIANTI from the meta-analysis had minimal to no effect on the observed associations. In our recent GWAS of plasma phospholipid n-3 fatty acids, the majority of identified variants were in genes encoding known regulatory enzymes for these fatty acids . In contrast, in the present study, variation in genes encoding proteins in the DNL pathway (e.g, stearoyl CoA desaturase) was not associated with DNL fatty acids. These results suggest that metabolic pathways other than DNL may influence circulating levels of these fatty acids, and also highlight the unique strength of appropriately powered, non-hypothesis-driven GWAS for identifying novel genetic polymorphisms that affect circulating fatty acids. Such approaches can be complemented by pathway-driven analyses in future work, e.g., focusing on known fatty acid regulatory genes that may not have been identified herein due to small effects or very low frequency. Potential limitations should be considered. The effect of polymorphisms on protein function is unknown and the identified variants explained little of the variance in fatty acid levels. Thus, our results highlight the need for additional studies to identify other factors, including direct dietary consumption, gene-environment interactions, and other endogenous metabolic processes that influence these fatty acids, and possible heterogeneity across populations. However, as with most other GWAS, we believe that the findings of our analysis are most relevant to identify new biologic pathways that influence these fatty acids and possibly DNL, rather than to account for population variation . It should be noted that each identified genetic loci contained many SNPs in high LD and we do not know which are the causal variants. Additionally, while the top findings were highly statistically significant, for SNPs with P-values close to the genome-wide threshold should be interpreted with caution, and future replication efforts are required to confirm these associations. Another limitation was that we focused on fatty acids which were major products of DNL and that were available in all cohorts in the consortium, Several other fatty acids in the DNL pathway (e.g. myristic acid) were therefore not investigated and should be the focus of future studies. Finally, each of the cohorts measured different number of fatty acids, which potentially introduced artificial variation in % fatty acid abundance in cross-cohort comparisons. However, the magnitude and direction of associations were mostly consistent across all 5 cohorts, suggesting the influence of different number of fatty acids measured had minimal effects on the SNP-fatty acid associations.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 28448, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "In conclusion, in the first reported GWAS of circulating levels of these fatty acids, we identified multiple novel genetic variants in genes with functions in protein N-glycosylation, polyunsaturated fatty acid metabolism, phospholipid modeling, and glucose and oxygen sensing pathways.

They are synthesized via de novo lipogenesis (DNL) and are the main saturated and mono-unsaturated fatty acids in the diet. Levels of these fatty acids have been linked to diseases including type 2 diabetes and coronary heart disease. Despite these findings suggesting importance of these fatty acids, the metabolic pathways and genetic variants that regulate and determine their circulating concentrations are not understood. Genome-wide association studies were conducted in 5 population-based cohorts comprising 8,961 participants of European ancestry to investigate the association of common genetic variation with plasma levels of these four fatty acids. We identified polymorphisms in 7 novel loci associated with circulating levels of one or more of these fatty acids. Polymorphisms associated with fatty acid levels were identified in genes with diverse functions, including protein-glycosylation (ALG14), polyunsaturated fatty acid metabolism (FADS1 and FADS2), phospholipid modeling (LPGAT1), and glucose- and oxygen- sensing pathways (GCKR and HIF1AN). These results expand our knowledge of genetic factors relevant to DNL and fatty acid biology, and will stimulate future research to investigate their potential role in cardio-metabolic diseases.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}], "annotations": [], "relations": []}]}
