is reproducibly associated with future risk of adult metabolic diseases including type 2 diabetes (T2D) and cardiovascular disease. These lifecourse associations have often been attributed to the impact of an adverse early life environment. We performed a multi-ancestry genome-wide association study (GWAS) meta-analysis of BW in 153,781 individuals, identifying 60 loci where foetal genotype was associated with BW (P <5x10-8). Overall, ~15% of variance in BW could be captured by assays of foetal genetic variation. Using genetic association alone, we found strong inverse genetic correlations between BW and systolic blood pressure (rg=-0.22, P =5.5x10-13), T2D (rg=-0.27, P =1.1x10-6) and coronary artery disease (rg=-0.30, P =6.5x10-9) and, in large cohort data sets, demonstrated that genetic factors were the major contributor to the negative covariance between BW and future cardiometabolic risk. Pathway analyses indicated that the protein products of genes within BW-associated regions were enriched for diverse processes including insulin signalling, glucose homeostasis, glycogen biosynthesis and chromatin remodelling. There was also enrichment of associations with BW in known imprinted regions (P =1.9x10-4).

However, the variance in BW captured collectively by all autosomal genotyped variants on the array was considerably larger, estimated at 15.1% (SE=0.9) in UK Biobank (Methods).

However, two lines of evidence indicated that variation in the foetal genome was the predominant driver of the BW associations. First, an analysis of the global contribution of maternal vs. foetal genetic variation, using a maternal-GCTA model (Methods) applied to 4,382 mother-child pairs, estimated that the child's genotype (sigmaC2=0.24, SE=0.11) makes a larger contribution to BW variance than either the mother's genotype (sigmaM2=0.04, SE=0.10), or the covariance between the two (sigmaCM=0.04, SE=0.08). Second, when we compared the point estimates of the BW effect size dependent on maternal genotype at each of the 60 loci (as measured in up to 68,254 women) with those dependent on foetal genotype (using European ancestry data from 143,677 individuals in the present study), foetal variation had greater impact than maternal at 93% of loci (55/60; binomial P=1x10-11) (Supplementary Table 10, Extended Data Figs 4, 5; Methods).

BW (in European ancestry samples) showed strong positive genetic correlations with anthropometric and obesity-related traits including birth length (rg=0.81, P=2.0x10-44), and in adults, height (rg=0.41, P=4.8x10-52), waist circumference (rg=0.18, P=3.9x10-10) and BMI (rg=0.11, P=7.3x10-6). In contrast, BW showed inverse genetic correlations with indicators of adverse metabolic and cardiovascular health including coronary artery disease (CAD, rg=-0.30, P=6.5x10-9), systolic blood pressure (SBP, rg=-0.22, P=5.5x10-13) and T2D (rg=-0.27, P=1.1x10-6) (Fig. 1, Supplementary Table 12 and Supplementary Fig. 2). These correlations between BW and adult cardiometabolic phenotypes are of similar magnitude, although directionally-opposite, to the reported genetic correlations between adult BMI and those same cardiometabolic outcomes. These findings support observational associations between a history of paternal T2D and lower BW, and establish more generally that the observed lifecourse associations between early growth and adult disease, at least in part, reflect the impact of shared genetic variants that influence both sets of phenotypes. In an effort to estimate the extent of genetic contribution to these lifecourse associations, we first focused on data from UK Biobank (n=57,715). For many of the traits for which data were available, genetic variation contributed substantially to the lifecourse relationship between BW and adult phenotypes, and in some cases appeared to be the major source of covariance between the traits. For example, we estimated that 85% (95% CI=70%-99%) of the negative covariance between BW and SBP was explained by shared genetic associations captured by directly genotyped SNPs (Supplementary Table 13; Methods). For continuous cardiometabolic measures, including lipids and fasting glycaemia, for which measures are not currently available in UK Biobank, we turned to the Northern Finland Birth Cohort (n=5,009), and obtained similar results (Supplementary Table 13). However, these estimates are limited, not only by wide confidence intervals, but also by the assumption of a linear relationship between BW and each of the phenotypes and by the inability to explicitly model maternal genotypic effects. In other words, the inverse genetic correlations between BW and cardiometabolic traits may not exclusively reflect genetic effects mediated directly through the offspring, but also effects mediated by maternal genotype acting indirectly via perturbation of the in utero environment. Nevertheless, these estimates indicate that a substantial proportion of the variance in cardiometabolic risk that covaries with BW can be attributed to the effects of common genetic variation.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 10518, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "To elucidate the biological pathways and processes underlying regulation of foetal growth, we first performed gene set enrichment analysis of our BW GWAS analysis using MAGENTA (Methods). Twelve pathways reached study-wide significance (FDR<0.05), including pathways involved in metabolism (insulin signalling, glycogen biosynthesis, cholesterol biosynthesis), growth (IGF-signalling, growth hormone pathway) and development (chromatin remodelling) (Extended Data Table 2a). Similar pathways were detected in a complementary analysis where we interrogated empirical protein-protein interaction (PPI) data identifying 13 PPI network modules with marked (z-score >5) enrichment for BW-association scores (Extended Data Table 2b and Extended Data Figs 6a, b; Methods).

Such enrichment is consistent with the \"parental conflict\" hypothesis regarding the allocation of maternal resources to the foetus. Although the role of imprinted genes in foetal growth is described in animal models and rare human disorders, our result is the first large-scale, systematic demonstration of their contribution to normal variation in BW. Of the 60 genome-wide significant loci, two (INS-IGF2, RB1) fall within (or near) imprinted regions (Extended Data Fig. 2b), with a noteworthy third signal at DLK1 (previously foetal antigen-1; P=5.6x10-8). Parent-of-origin specific analyses to further investigate these individual loci (comparing heterozygote vs. homozygote BW variance in 57,715 unrelated individuals, and testing BW associations with paternal vs. maternal alleles in 4,908 mother-child pairs; see Methods) proved, despite these sample sizes, to be underpowered (Extended Data Fig. 7 and Supplementary Tables 15, 16).", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 12596, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Many of the genome-wide signals for BW detected here are also established genome-wide association signals for a wide variety of cardiometabolic traits (Fig. 2).

To highlight processes implicated in specific BW-trait associations, we overlaid these PoC PPI with the 50 pathways over-represented in the global BW PPI network. These analyses revealed, for example, that proteins in the Wnt canonical signalling pathway were only detected in the PoC PPI network for BP traits. We can use these PPI overlaps to highlight the specific transcripts within BW GWAS loci that are likely to mediate the mechanistic links. For example, the overlap between the Wnt signalling pathway and the PoC PPI network for the intersection of BW and BP-related traits implicates FZD9 as the likely effector gene at the MLXIPL BW locus (Extended Data Fig. 6d and Supplementary Table 6).", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 14860, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "We focused our more detailed investigation of the mechanistic links between early growth and adult traits on two phenotypic areas: arterial BP and T2D/glycaemia.

However, we also observed locus-specific heterogeneity in the genetic relationships between BP and BW: the SBP-raising allele at ADRB1 is associated with higher, rather than lower, BW (Extended Data Fig. 8a).

Observational data link paternal diabetes with lower offspring BW indicating that the inheritance of T2D risk alleles by the foetus tends, in line with the LD score regression analysis, to reduce growth. These relationships are consistent with the precepts of the \"foetal insulin hypothesis\" and reflect the potential for reduced insulin secretion and/or signalling to lead to both reduced foetal growth and, many decades later, enhanced predisposition to T2D. In line with this, the inferred paternal transmitted haplotype score generated from the 84 T2D risk variants was associated with lower BW (P=0.045) in 5,201 mother-child pairs (Methods; Supplementary Table 18). In contrast, maternal diabetes is observationally associated with higher offspring BW, reflecting the impact of maternal hyperglycaemia to stimulate foetal insulin secretion. The contribution of genotype-dependent maternal hyperglycaemia to BW is in line with the evidence, from a recent study, that maternal genotype scores for fasting glucose and T2D (conditional on foetal genotype) were causally associated with higher offspring BW. It is also consistent with the observation that a subset of glucose-raising alleles is associated with higher BW. For example, the T2D-risk variant at MTNR1B (which also has a particularly marked effect on fasting glucose levels in non-diabetic indivudals) was amongst the subset of BW loci (5/60) for which the BW effect attributable to maternal genotype exceeded that associated with the foetal genotype (maternal: beta=0.048, P=5.1x10-15; foetal: beta=0.023, P=2.9x10-8) (Supplementary Table 10, Extended Data Figs 4, 5). Thus, both maternal and foetal genetic effects connect BW to later T2D risk, albeit acting in opposing directions. When we categorised T2D loci using a classification of physiological function derived from their effects on related glycaemic and anthropometric traits, we found that T2D-risk alleles associated with lower BW were those typically characterised by reduced insulin processing and secretion without detectable changes in fasting glucose (the \"Beta Cell\" cluster in Extended Data Fig. 8f).", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 20786, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The YTK6 signal at rs138715366 is notable, not only because the genetic data indicates that a single low-frequency non-coding variant is driving the association signal (see above) but because of the proximity of this signal to GCK.

Variants with high LD Scores are more likely to contain more true signals and hence provide more chance of overlap with genuine signals between GWAS. The LD score regression method uses summary statistics from the GWAS meta-analysis of BW and the other traits of interest, calculates the cross-product of test statistics at each SNP, and then regresses the cross-product on the LD Score.

Thus, if there is sample overlap (or cryptic relatedness between samples), it will only affect the intercept from the regression (i.e. the term ) and not the slope, and hence estimates of the genetic covariance will not be biased by sample overlap.

Where the sample size for each SNP was included in the results file this was flagged using --N-col; if no sample size was available then the maximum sample size reported in the reference for the GWAS meta-analysis was used. SNPs were excluded for the following reasons: MAF<0.01; ambiguous strand; duplicate rsID; non-autosomal SNPs; reported sample size less than 60% of the total available. Once all files were reformatted, we used the ldsc.py python script, also on the developers' website, to calculate the genetic correlation between BW and each of the traits and diseases. The European LD Score files that were calculated from the 1000G reference panel and provided by the developers were used for the analysis. Where multiple GWAS meta-analyses had been conducted on the same phenotype (i.e. over a period of years), the genetic correlation with BW was estimated using each set of summary statistics and presented in Supplementary Table 12. The phenotypes with multiple GWAS included height, BMI, waist-hip ratio (adjusted for BMI), total cholesterol, triglycerides, high density lipoprotein (HDL) and low density lipoprotein (LDL). The estimate of the genetic correlation between the multiple GWAS meta-analyses on the same phenotype were comparable and the later GWAS had a smaller standard error due to the increased sample size, so only the genetic correlation between BW and the most recent meta-analyses were presented in Fig. 2.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 44438, "infons": {"section_type": "METHODS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "In the published GWAS for BP the phenotype was adjusted for BMI. Caution is needed when interpreting the genetic correlation between BW and BMI-adjusted SBP due to the potential for collider bias. Since BMI is associated with both BP and BW, it is possible that the use of a BP genetic score adjusted for BMI might bias the genetic correlation estimate towards a more negative value. To verify that the inverse genetic correlation with BW (rg=-0.26, SE=0.05, P=6.5x10-9) was not due to collider bias caused by the BMI adjustment of the phenotype, we obtained an alternative estimate using UK Biobank GWAS data for SBP that was unadjusted for BMI and obtained a similar result (rg=-0.22, SE=0.03, P=5.5x10-13). The SBP phenotype in UK Biobank was prepared as follows. Two BP readings were taken at assessment, approximately 5 minutes apart. We included all individuals with an automated BP reading (taken using an automated Omron BP monitor). Two valid measurements were available for most participants (averaged to create a BP variable, or alternatively a single reading was used if only one was available). Individuals were excluded if the two readings differed by more than 4.56 SD. BP measurements more than 4.56 SD away from the mean were excluded. We accounted for BP medication use by adding 15 mmHg to the SBP measure. BP was adjusted for age, sex and centre location and then inverse rank normalised.

MAGENTA implements a gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) based approach, as previously described. Briefly, each gene in the genome is mapped to a single index SNP with the lowest P-value within a 110 kb upstream and 40 kb downstream window. This P-value, representing a gene score, is then corrected for confounding factors such as gene size, SNP density and LD-related properties in a regression model. Genes within the HLA-region were excluded from analysis due to difficulties in accounting for gene density and LD patterns. Each mapped gene in the genome is then ranked by its adjusted gene score. At a given significance threshold (95th and 75th percentiles of all gene scores), the observed number of gene scores in a given pathway, with a ranked score above the specified threshold percentile, is calculated. This observed statistic is then compared to 1,000,000 randomly permuted pathways of identical size. This generates an empirical GSEA P-value for each pathway. Significance was attained when an individual pathway reached a false discovery rate (FDR) <0.05 in either analysis.
