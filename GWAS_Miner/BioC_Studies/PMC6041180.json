OD is a genetically complex disorder that is influenced by complex environmental factors, such as drug availability, making it difficult to identify genetic factors that underlie the disorder. Genome-wide association study (GWAS) is an unbiased way to search for novel genetic factors contributing to OD. We completed the first GWAS of OD (with DSM-IV criterion count as the phenotype definition, using all available subjects) and found two genome-wide significant single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in African-Americans (AAs). These two SNPs map to KCNC1 (potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily C member 1) and KCNG2 (potassium voltage-gated channel modifier subfamily G member 2), respectively, which are involved in potassium signaling pathways. Pathway-based GWAS analysis also demonstrated an enrichment of genes involved in calcium signaling and long-term potentiation. There have been fewer findings in European-Americans (EAs), where the only GWAS to date to identify variants associated to OD in EAs showed an association with CNIH3.

The rationale for using ESLiMc was that if there are no alternative splicing events, an increase in the global expression of a gene should correlate with a higher expression of all of its exons. Linear regression was used by ESLiMc to establish the above relationship between each exon and its corresponding gene. The difference (referred to as gene-exon residual regression score) generated by ESLiMc between the observed exon expression and the predicted exon expression was interpreted as being due to an alternative splicing.

For RGMA, there was a strong positive correlation with GRIN1 (Pearson correlation coefficient r=0.40 and P=7.0x10-50) and KCNIP3 (r=0.38 and P=1.35x10-45) (Supplementary figure 4B), with the latter two also significantly inter-correlated (Supplementary figure 4A: r=0.73 and P=1x10-200).", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 22959, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "Discussion", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 22970, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "We report here results from a GWAS of opioid criterion count in EA subjects. There was a GWS association of an RGMA variant, rs12442183, in Yale-Penn 1. There was nominally significant evidence for association of the same variant in both Yale-Penn 2 and Yale-Penn 3, and when all EA samples (including SAGE, where no evidence of the association was obtained) were meta-analyzed together, the significance of the association finding increased. Because the minor allele frequency of rs12442183 was similar for the EA and AA populations, we further evaluated the association of rs12442183 with OD in the Yale-Penn AA sample. The nominally significant association in the AA meta-analysis (n=2014, meta-P=3x10-3) further supports the association. (AA replication of results from EA samples is not universally applicable, but in this case, we found evidence that we believe is of value.) Cis-eQTL analysis of RGMA in brain showed the rs12442183*T risk allele to be associated with higher expression of RGMA transcript variant 4 (encoding RGMa isoform 3) in frontal cortex. This observation is consistent with the upregulation of Rgma in C57BL/J6 mice treated with morphine chronically, which is not the case in three other mouse strains: DBA/2J, 129P3/J and SWR/J. C57BL/6J mice have a greater preference for oral self-administration of morphine than three other strains. Further co-expression analysis in large brain tissue expression datasets demonstrated significant correlation between the expression of RGMA and that of four genes that have been shown to affect risk for other psychiatric disorders, GRIN1 (schizophrenia), KCNIP3 (Alzheimer's disease), FXYD6 (schizophrenia) and PTCHD1 (autism), as well as two transcription factors TCF3 and TCF4. The latter gene TCF4 is a schizophrenia-risk gene. These RGMA co-expressed genes are critical to normal brain function, supporting the potential involvement of RGMA in related biological processes.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 24916, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The protein product of RGMA, RGMa, is a glycosylphosphatidylinosital-anchored glycoprotein that exists in membrane-bound and soluble forms, both of which are potent regulators of cell death and inhibitors of nerve growth. RGMa was first reported to be a developmental neurite growth inhibitor. It has since emerged as an important factor inhibiting neuronal regeneration and functional recovery. RGMa inhibits neurite growth by binding to its neuronal receptor, neogenin, a member of the immunoglobulin (Ig) superfamily. Neogenin overexpression and RGMa down expression in the developing embryonic neural tube induce apoptosis. RGMa may be involved in neuroplasticity consistent with increased secretion of RGMa in stroke- or injury-damaged human brain tissue, in the plaque regions of Alzheimer's disease patients, in the substantia nigra of Parkinson's disease patients, and in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients. Considering the example of progressive MS, RGMa was found in active and chronic lesions, and in normal-appearing gray and white matter, and was expressed by cellular meningeal infiltrates in autopsy material. Levels of soluble RGMa in the cerebrospinal fluid were decreased in progressive MS patients for whom treatment resulted in functional improvement. Antibody-mediated neutralization of RGMa or downregulation of RGMa can result in neuroprotection and enhanced functional recovery.

However, Rgma was specifically upregulated in C57BL/6J mice (in contrast to the other 3 mouse strains) following chronic morphine treatment. The different responses of these mouse strains after chronic or acute morphine treatment may reflect genetic differences, as C57BL/6J mice have been reported to have the greatest preference for orally self-administered morphine of the strains studied. Further, in the current study, risk rs12442183*T-allele carriers demonstrated a higher expression of one RGMA transcript in frontal cortex. As downregulation of RGMa can result in neuroprotection and enhanced functional recovery and increased RGMa in brain is associated with risk of multiple neurological disorders, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and multiple sclerosis, downregulation of RGMa may have a protective effect on neurons after acute morphine treatment, while upregulation of RGMa may induce brain vulnerability with chronic morphine treatment.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 27747, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "In the analysis of several brain tissue samples, RGMA expression was associated with the expression of four other genes related to psychiatric traits, GRIN1, KCNIP3, FXYD6 and PTCHD1. GRIN1 was the gene that was most highly co-expressed (r=0.40) with RGMA in brain. It plays a key role in synaptic plasticity, synaptogenesis, excitotoxicity, memory acquisition and learning. GRIN1 can tether the mu-opioid receptor (the main biological target of opioid drugs) and subsequently immobilize the mu-opioid receptor within lipid rafts. The overexpression of GRIN1 increases the amount of mu-opioid receptor in lipid rafts and the magnitude of receptor signaling. The significant correlation between the expression of other genes (PTCHD1, FXYD6, and KCNIP3) and that of RGMA, may reflect their critical function in the brain.

Neither the SSADDA (Yale-Penn) nor the SSAGA (SAGE) differentiates prescribed from illegal-recreational use of opioids, and therefore some subjects who endorsed DSM-IV OD criteria probably did so despite using opioids therapeutically. However, a majority (59.5%) of individuals in our samples who met criteria for OD endorsed at least five of the seven diagnostic criteria (mean criterion count = 6.6, Supplementary figure 1), suggesting that the GWS finding is attributable to moderate-to-severe OD, rather than being contributed to substantially by individuals who used opioids as prescribed, but required an increased dosage for pain control or who experienced withdrawal symptoms when opioid treatment was discontinued. The much greater proportion of participants in the Yale-Penn samples than SAGE who met the maximum number of (i.e., seven) OD criteria supports that interpretation. Also, compared to our (Yale-Penn) samples, the SAGE samples were recruited for alcoholism, cocaine dependence, or nicotine dependence, rather than OD. Therefore, a much higher percentage of opioid-exposed individuals in SAGE are \"controls\": viz. individuals who used opioids fewer than 11 times lifetime and would have skipped out of the remainder of the SSAGA opioid section and had a null criterion count (Supplementary figure 1). Additionally, the relative percentage of opioid-exposed individuals varies considerably across our three Yale-Penn EA samples because of the different recruiting epochs, although the assessment protocol did not change: the earlier Yale-Penn samples were more focused on OD recruitment than the later ones.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 30583, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "In summary, we report a GWS association of rs12442183, at the RGMA locus, with OD.

We believe that the former two differences were key in our identification of the present very robust association finding. The finding was GWS in our largest sample taken separately, with nominally significant associations of the same variant in two of three other available samples of EAs. Further support was obtained in AA samples. Our current data support a model in which the regulatory variant rs12442183 affects expression of RGMA transcript variant 4 in frontal cortex, and the consequent variation in RGMa isoform 3 may alter the response to opioids, a potential underlying mechanism for its association with OD.
