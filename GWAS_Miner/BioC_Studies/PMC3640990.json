We identified two regions of interest that were each unique to subjects of genetically determined ancestry to the African continent (AA) or to the European continent (EA). WBC varies among different ancestry groups. Despite being ancestry specific, these regions were identifiable in the combined analysis. In AA subjects, the region surrounding the Duffy antigen/chemokine receptor gene (DARC) on 1q21 exhibited significant association (p value = 6.71e-55). These results validate the previously reported association between WBC and of the regulatory variant rs2814778 in the promoter region, which causes the Duffy negative phenotype (Fy-/-). A second missense variant (rs12075) is responsible for the two principal antigens, Fya and Fyb of the Duffy blood group system. The two variants, consisting of four alleles, act in concert to produce five antigens and subsequent phenotypes. We were able to identify the marginal and novel interaction effects of these two variants on WBC. In the EA subjects, we identified significantly associated SNPs tagging three separate genes in the 17q21 region: (1) GSDMA, (2) MED24, and (3) PSMD3.

Figure 2 also provides a zoomed-in plot of chromosome 17, and further of the 17q21.1 region illustrating genes and directions of transcription. Increasing in genomic coordinates, GSDMA is one of the genes tagged with the most significant association for both the EA (p value   e-12) and pooled (p value   e-11) analyses. The pooled sample minor allele for this intronic variant (rs3859192) was also the ancestral allele (A), but the frequency was 0.45. In the EA sample, higher numbers of copies of this allele were associated with higher WBC levels (beta = 0.14, S.E. = 0.02), and this association was present in the overall pooled sample (beta = 0.14, S.E. = 0.02). This SNP was in moderate LD (r2 = 0.492) with a missense variant (rs3894194) that was suggestive in our EA (2.01e-07) and pooled (2.29e-07) samples (see Table 3). Higher numbers of copies of the minor allele were associated with higher values of WBC. For the EA sample beta = 0.11 (S.E. = 0.02), and for the pooled sample beta = 0.10 (S.E. = 0.02). Moving towards 3' as illustrated in Fig. 2, the next significant association was found in the PSMD3 gene, intronic SNP rs4065321. As listed in Table 3, this variant is in moderate LD with the GSDMA intronic SNP rs3859192 (r2 = 0.458). The MAFs (0.45 and 0.44), effect sizes (both beta = 0.14) and significance (p value = 3.47e-11 and 1.43e-12) were similar to rs3859192 in the EA and pooled analyses. On the anti-sense strand, there was a genome-wide significant intronic SNP (rs9916158) found in the MED24 gene. As outlined in Table 3, this SNP was significant in the EA (p value = 4.92e-10) and pooled analyses (p value = 8.86e-10). The sample minor allele (A) was associated with lower median WBC. For the EA sample beta = -0.13 (S.E. = 0.02), and for the pooled sample beta = -0.13 (S.E. = 0.02). This variant is in moderate LD with the GSDMA intronic SNP rs3859192 (r2 = 0.410). None of the 17q21.1 SNPs associated with WBC in EA analyses were found to be significantly associated in analyses of AA (all p value > 0.05).", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 25593, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "Discussion", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 25604, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Through the eMERGE Network, we were able to successfully mine electronic medical records linked to five U.S. cohorts encompassing 13,923 subjects for WBC.

The direction of effect in our results support the hypothesis that DARC on red blood cells acts as a chemokine sink, limiting the stimulation of leukocytes by IL-8 in the blood. Chemokines play a key role in trafficking leukocytes in the blood. The two Duffy variants interact to account for WBC variance observed in our AA sample, as evidenced by the lack of association from the genome-wide analyses of the residuals derived from the novel two-SNP, interaction model described in the \"Results\" section (Fig. 4). Still unexplained is the X chromosome peak in the AA subjects. This signal was also eliminated when \"Duffy\" was controlled for in the residual model derived from the two-SNP, interaction model. While we continue to study these effects, we suspect they may represent an artifact of different patterns of admixture in males versus females of recent African origin. The atypically broad region of association on chromosome 1 demonstrated in Fig. 1 may be due to selective sweep in the genetic region surrounding Duffy in geographic areas with high prevalence of P. vivax and P. knowlesi. This selective sweep also leads to spurious associations in regional genes not relevant to WBC. Such associations could have been misleading had Duffy not been typed. This suggests the need for caution in interpreting associations in atypically broad regions of association.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 28247, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "title_2"}, "text": "17q21.1 region", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 28262, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Our 17q21.1 association results in the EA subjects provided further evidence that this region may play a role in regulating inflammatory processes and disorders. In our EA subjects, we identified a genome-wide significant region that tagged three separate genes: (1) GSDMA, (2) MED24, and (3) PSMD3. The HaemGen consortium used meta-analysis to identify one variant (rs17609240) with an association with WBC of genome-wide significance; this variant was on 17q21.1 near ORMDL3, a known susceptibility locus for childhood asthma (childhood asthma [MIM 610075]). A study of WBC in Japanese individuals identified another SNP (rs4065321) in the same region. Others have linked this region to neutrophil count levels, and to the inflammatory disorders asthma, Crohn's disease (IBD22 [MIM 612380]) and type 1 diabetes (IDDM [MIM 222100]). Other genes in the same region include GSDMA, MED24, and PSMD3. PSMD3 encodes one of the non-ATPase subunits of the 19S regulator lid for the multicatalytic proteinase complex that is involved in many cellular functions including inflammatory responses, and apoptosis. Another gene in close proximity is CSF3, which encodes colony stimulating factor 3, a cytokine controlling the production, differentiation and function of granulocytes. ORMDL3 has been identified as a potential risk factor for asthma. Through a combination of global and target studies, identified Orm proteins as homeostatic regulators of sphingolipid biosynthesis. Moffatt et al. identified genetic 17q21.1 variants regulating ORMDL3 expression and its contribution to the risk of childhood asthma. Two of these variants associated with asthma (rs3894194 and rs3859192) are missense and intronic SNPs found in GSDMA that were associated to WBC in our EA sample.
