The development of T2D is influenced by diverse factors, and decades of epidemiological studies have linked obesity, hypertension, and dyslipidemia with the risk of T2D. It is also known that T2D shows considerable heritability. Within only the last three years, genetic studies have yielded a rapidly lengthening list of loci harboring disease predisposing variations. To date, genetic variants at forty-five loci have been identified for T2D. Despite these advances toward a better understanding of the genetic basis of T2D, its heritability is yet to be fully explained. In addition, most T2D loci have been detected initially in population samples of European origin, apart from KCNQ1, UBE2E2, and C2CD4A-C2CD4B, which were first identified in East Asian studies. Additional efforts involving East Asian populations have identified variants at the SPRY2, PTPRD and SRR loci. However, these have not been extensively replicated in multiple populations. A large meta-analysis in East Asians is expected to identify novel genetic associations and provide insights into T2D pathogenesis. In addition to differences in the allele frequencies between East Asians and Europeans, which may affect the power to detect associations, T2D epidemiology also differs considerably among different European populations and East Asian populations. In East Asians, the rates of diabetes are often higher at a lower average BMI's, suggesting that some different pathways may be involved in pathogenesis of T2D.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 2694, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "To discover new T2D loci, we conducted a three-stage association study in individuals of East Asian descent (Supplementary Fig. 1).

One such locus was detected within an intron of GLIS3, a gene that is highly expressed in islet beta cells. The coding product of this gene, a Kruppel-like zinc finger transcription factor, has been proposed as a critical player in the regulation of pancreatic beta cell development and insulin gene expression. SNPs in high LD with this locus have already been implicated in association with type 1 diabetes (T1D) and fasting plasma glucose. The second locus, on 19q13, is located in an intron of PEPD. Several SNPs (lead SNP: rs10425678) in this gene were identified in association with T2D previously in Japanese . However, the SNP in our study (rs3786897) is not in LD with those identified in Japanese (r2 = 0.008 and D' = 0.143 between rs3786897 and rs10425678), and our GWA data do not support an association for T2D with rs10425678 (P = 0.528). The third such signal is near FITM2-R3HDML-HNF4A. FITM2 may be involved in lipid droplet accumulation, while the function of R3HDML is not known. Mutations in HNF4A cause maturity onset diabetes of the young type 1 (MODY1). Common variants, rs1884613 and rs2144908, in the P2 promoter region of this gene have been associated with T2D in a population-specific manner.

KCNK16, expressed predominantly in the pancreas, encodes a potassium channel protein containing two pore-forming P domains. In pancreatic beta cells, potassium channels that are inhibited by ATP regulate glucose-dependent insulin secretion. Among the variants in strong LD with this signal (rs1535500) is rs11756091 (r2 = 0.977, D' = 1.0 based on phase2 CHB/JPT HapMap data), which encodes a proline-to-histidine substitution in two isoforms of KCNK16. This or other variants influencing this gene may result in defective regulation of potassium channel activity contributing to the etiology of T2D. MAEA encodes a protein that plays a role in erythroblast enucleation and in the development of mature macrophages. The gene-set analysis of the stage 1 P-values using GSA-SNP indicated that MAEA belongs to a group of genes that showed significant association with T2D and includes IDE located at a known T2D susceptibility locus (stage 1 P = 1.41x10-7 for rs6583826 at the IDE locus in this study). The GRIP domain containing protein encoded by GCC1 may play a role in the organization of the trans-Golgi network involved in membrane transport . PAX4 that is only 30kb further away from GCC1 is an outstanding candidate for T2D given its involvement in pancreatic islet development. This gene was recently implicated in a Japanese case of MODY. The expression product of PSMD6 that acts as a regulatory subunit of the 26S proteasome is likely involved in the ATP-dependent degradation of ubiquitinated proteins . Although the function of ZFAND3 has not been fully elucidated, it is noteworthy that family member ZFAND6 is present along with FAH at a T2D locus detected previously. We examined whether 8 novel loci may be associated with T2D through an effect on obesity, as seen with FTO.

Secondly, we looked up the associations for all known T1D associated variants in our study. Only a given number of loci survived from the tests applied (Supplementary Table 10). This is in distinct contrast to the situation for known T2D associated variants where many replicated in our study (Supplementary Table 3), further suggesting that our findings are most relevant to T2D. Finally, since variants close to the GLIS3 locus have been shown to be associated with T1D, we examined the association between rs7041847 and diabetes in four studies (n=8,383) in which cases with positive GAD antibodies had been excluded (data not shown). In each study, the association between this SNP and diabetes was the same as when all samples were included (meta-analysis P-value = 3.4x10-4, OR = 1.12). This finding, along with the fact that SNPs at the GLIS3 locus also show associations with fasting plasma glucose in nondiabetic adults and healthy children and adolescents, is consistent with the hypothesis that SNPs at this locus may impact fasting glucose homeostasis rather than the immune system.
