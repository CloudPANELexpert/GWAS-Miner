The objective of this paper is to perform GWAS of AD in several study populations and investigate possible roles of detected genetic factors in developing AD hallmarks and in other health disorders. The data collected in the Framingham Heart Study (FHS), Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS), Health and Retirement Study (HRS) and Late Onset Alzheimer's Disease Family Study (LOADFS) were used in these analyses. The logistic regression and Cox's regression were used as statistical models in GWAS. The results of analyses confirmed strong associations of genetic variants from well-known genes APOE, TOMM40, PVRL2 (NECTIN2), and APOC1 with AD. Possible roles of these genes in pathological mechanisms resulting in development of hallmarks of AD are described. Many genes whose connection with AD was detected in other studies showed nominally significant associations with this health disorder in our study. The evidence on genetic connections between AD and vulnerability to infection, as well as between AD and other health disorders, such as cancer and type 2 diabetes, were investigated.

Despite substantial efforts to understand its causes and biological mechanisms the etiology of AD remains largely unknown. There are no medications that can notably influence rate of AD progression when it started.

Altogether, available information about this SNP (briefly summarized in Table 3) suggests that its phenotypic effects may not necessary be related to functions of TOMM40 itself, but may also be related to the functions of APOE and/or NECTIN2. This means that mechanism connecting rs2075650 and AD may potentially involve biological effects of any or all of these genes; for instance, it could be related to mitochondrial function via TOMM40 and APOE, to lipid transport via APOE, and to resistance to viral infection via APOE and NECTIN2 and their products.

Studies of interaction between these genes support a possibility of AD mechanism that involves collective effects of genes on chromosome 19 that have been associated with the disease.

This indicates that the SNPs associated with AD may contribute to AD through regulatory effects, by influencing transcription levels and resulting protein concentrations, without changes in protein structure. It is also important to note that while most SNPs from Table 3 are in LD with the SNPs in PVRL2 gene, the rs6859, which is actually located in PVRL2 gene, is not in LD with SNPs in the other genes. This indicates that PVRL2 (NECTIN2) may potentially be main gene functionally related to AD (of the top four AD-associated genes in this study: TOMM40, APOE, APOC1, PVRL2). PVRL2 involvement in AD could be, e.g., through its role in cell adhesion and brain's susceptibility to viral infections, the latter was also suggested for APOE and APOC1. This warrants further research into the role of 'brain vulnerability to infection' in AD development, and deserves a deeper look into functions of the detected genes.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 16442, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "PVRL2 (poliovirus receptor-related 2, formerly herpesvirus entry mediator B, HVEB), a.k.a.

It also serves as an entry for certain mutant strains of herpes and pseudorabies viruses, and is involved in cell to cell spreading of these viruses. The fact that AD-associated SNPs in TOMM40 and APOE both influence expression of PVRL2 indicates that biological effects of PVRL2 may at least in part explain observed genetic associations with AD. PVRL2 is important for maintaining proper cell junctions and the extra-cellular matrix (ECM) structure. Proper cell junctions are in turn important to control BBB permeability and may protect brain from spreading the viral infection, which was suggested to play role in AD PVRL2 and respective protein were also implemented in cancer. The gene is also responsive to plasma cholesterol acting at endothelial sites of vascular inflammation and could potentially be a new therapeutic target for atherosclerosis prevention. The involvement of PVRL2 in lymphomagenesis has been previously suggested to play a role in the pathogenesis of acute myeloid leukemia and in lymphomagenesis. Furthermore, gene expression profiling performed on hepatocellular carcinomas revealed an up-regulation of PVRL2, which was supposed to participate in the inhibit ion of apoptosis in hepatoma cells. In GWAS of the late onset AD in African Americans, SNPs related to APOE, PVRL2, TOMM40 and APOC1 also showed genome-wide significant associations with AD. Importantly, the association of rs6859 of PVRL2 with AD remained statistically significant after adjusting for the effect of APOE, which supports its independent role in AD.

The rs769449 is also in moderate LDs (r2 ~0.5-0.6) with rs12721046 in APOC1 and rs2075650 in TOMM40, which are of the same strength as LDs between these SNPs and rs429358. This supports the possibility that rs769449 actually represents APOE e2/e3/e4 polymorphism in this study, and the genome-wide significant effect of rs769449 on AD that we observed in HRS data (Table 2.1) is probably related to that effect of APOE e4. The involvement of APOE gene in AD has been confirmed more than two decades ago. The product of this gene interacts with Abeta and that the presence of APOE e4 isoform of this gene in a person's genome increases his/her risks of AD. In the brain apolipoprotein E (apoE) is synthesized predominantly by astrocytes. It is the primary transporter of cholesterol within the blood brain barrier (BBB). ApoE interacts with Abeta during its aggregation and deposition and together they influence risks of AD development. Many studies confirm the presence of such interaction, however, explanations of its nature differ considerably from one study to the next. Recently provided evidence that the apoE proteins do not bind to soluble (i.e., monomeric) Abeta. found that apoE may interact with the Abeta oligomers and fibrils. The researchers emphasized considerable heterogeneity in the size and structures of the Abeta oligomers that are likely to influence such interaction. The presence of APOE e4 variant may also affect Abeta accumulation in brain. Studies of longitudinal cohorts showed that APOE e4 was significantly associated with lower CSF Abeta1-42, suggesting increased Abeta deposition in brain. ApoE is involved in complex relationships with Abeta suitable to cross the BBB that may regulate Abeta clearance. E.g., apoE4 animals showed reduced Abeta clearance across the BBB compared to apoE3 animals, linked to less efficient regulation by apoE4 isoform of lipoprotein receptor shedding. Alternative pathways of Abeta clearance could be mediated by microglia. Brains of AD patients carrying the APOE e4 allele were found to have increased density of Abeta deposits, limited capacity to clear Abeta and enhanced neuro-inflammation. Despite an association between neurodegenerative disease and APOEe4 many APOEe4 non-carriers develop AD. Analyses of genetic associations of people without APOEe4 allele showed that rs2075650 in TOMM40 is still associated with AD.

This hypothesis states that, in the sporadic AD, mitochondrial dysfunction is the primary event that causes Abeta deposition, synaptic degeneration, NFTs formation, and neuronal death. Indeed, there is a bulk of studies showing that mitochondrial dysfunction is a common event in AD. Although this theory looks plausible, some problems remains. The dysfunction of mitochondria due to relevant TOMM40 SNPs should lead to inadequate ATP (and/or ROS) production, both of which could negatively affect the neuron and glia metabolism in the bearers of relevant SNPs, possibly accelerating death of respective cell types. If the mitochondrial dysfunction decreases ATP output, then it should also negatively affect global rate and bulk of protein phosphorylation, including tau phosphorylation necessary for NFT formation.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 27008, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "title_2"}, "text": "4.7.

Although the biological mechanism that links the progression of T2D and AD is not completely understood the growing evidence supports the concept that AD is a metabolic health disorder that is caused by progressive inability of the brain's to properly respond to insulin and insulin-like growth factor (IGF) stimulation to utilize glucose. The connection between T2D and AD is also manifested in several similarities between the developments of two pathologies. These include uncontrolled glucose metabolism, glucose toxicity, a direct effect of insulin on amyloid metabolism, oxidative stress, abnormal protein processing, stimulation of inflammatory pathways and inflammation, hypercholesterolemia, dyslipidemia, impaired central nervous response to the adipose tissue-derived hormone leptin, increased oxidative stress and production of advanced glycation end products.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 29001, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "In addition to similarities between T2D and AD, described above, studies often provide controversial evidence about effects of different factors on disease development.

This study demonstrated an inverse association between cancer and AD. Small inverse associations between cancer and AD were detected in. The authors concluded that these associations might be caused by ascertainment bias due to decreased awareness of non-melanoma skin cancers (NMSC) in persons with undiagnosed early cognitive impairment or by confounding from a more neuroprotective lifestyle among persons with NMSC. The obesity-related mechanism may be involved in trade-off between cancer and AD. The leptin and adiponectin produced by adipose tissues may be responsible for this property. Leptin has cancer-stimulating and AD-inhibiting actions while, in contrast, adiponectin has cancer-inhibiting and AD-stimulating properties.

At autopsy, participants with a history of cancer had significantly fewer paired helical filament (PHF) tau tangles (p < 0.001) than participants without a history of cancer, but similar levels of Abeta. Comprehensive review of cellular pathways with roles in cancers, cell survival, growth, proliferation, development, aging, and also contributing to AD disease showed the possibility of inverse relationship between AD and cancer.

Proper cell junctions are important to control brain blood barrier (BBB) permeability and protect the brain from infection, especially from viruses, which may play a role in AD.
