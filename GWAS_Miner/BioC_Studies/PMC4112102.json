Once again, p-values for individual variants for LAS and CAD significantly correlated at this locus. Variants at RAI1-PEMT-RASD1 also significantly associated with IS but the OR and level of significance was lower than for LAS, suggesting that the association with IS is driven by the association with LAS. Interestingly, the RAI1-PEMT-RASD1 locus has so far not been associated with other traits or diseases known to relate to the vascular system. Another locus significantly associated with both LAS and CAD and not previously reported as being associated with LAS is EDNRA. This locus has been associated with carotid artery atherosclerosis  suggesting that this locus acts by promoting early atherogenesis.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 21773, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Finally, several loci displayed highly significant associations with CAD, while showing no association with LAS or IS.

We did not control for comorbid vascular disease because the information was not available for most of the participants.

Also, several of the top signals for CAD displayed no association with IS or LAS. We can largely exclude a referral bias favoring the selection of stroke patients with a diagnosis of CAD since the majority of subjects included into METASTROKE were recruited through acute stroke services or through population-based studies. There may have been some enrichment for patients with a history of stroke among subjects recruited into CARDIoGRAM/C4D.
