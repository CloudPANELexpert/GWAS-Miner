A genome-wide association study of usual sleep duration was conducted using 18 population-based cohorts totaling 47,180 individuals of European ancestry. Genome-wide significant association was identified at two loci. The strongest is located on chromosome 2, in an intergenic region 35-80 kb upstream from the thyroid-specific transcription factor PAX8 (lowest p=1.1 x 10-9). This finding was replicated in an African-American sample of 4771 individuals (lowest p=9.3 x 10-4). The strongest combined association was at rs1823125 (p=1.5 x 10-10, minor allele frequency 0.26 in the discovery sample, 0.12 in the replication sample), with each copy of the minor allele associated with a sleep duration 3.1 minutes longer per night. The alleles associated with longer sleep duration were associated in previous genome-wide association studies with a more favorable metabolic profile and a lower risk of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Understanding the mechanisms underlying these associations may help elucidate biological mechanisms influencing sleep duration and its association with psychiatric, metabolic and cardiovascular disease.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 1451, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "INTRODUCTION", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 1464, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Usual sleep duration is an important determinant of daytime sleepiness; moreover, both short and long sleep duration have been consistently associated with psychiatric illness, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, coronary heart disease and mortality, although the mechanisms underlying these associations are poorly understood. Significant heritability of usual sleep duration has been reported from twin studies, with heritability estimates generally in the range of 0.40-0.55. A number of neurotransmitters and neuropeptides are known to regulate sleep-wake behavior, and genetic screens in non-mammalian vertebrates have demonstrated an important role of ion channels, which regulate neural activity (reviewed in). Polymorphisms in the human period 2 (PER2) and casein kinase 1d (CSNK1D) genes, known elements of the circadian molecular clock, are associated with autosomal dominant advanced sleep phase syndrome in isolated pedigrees. The genetic basis for heritability of usual sleep duration, however, remains largely unknown. Candidate gene studies have inconsistently implicated genes associated with the mammalian circadian clock, including BHLHE41 (DEC2) and CLOCK, and the glutamate receptor-encoding GRIA3. In a small genome-wide association study (GWAS) of usual sleep duration in 749 Framingham Heart Study participants, no genome-wide significant associations were identified. Recently, a GWAS in over 4000 individuals in seven European cohorts identified a polymorphism in ABCC9, encoding an ATP-sensitive potassium channel, that explained approximately 5% of the variance in usual sleep duration. This finding was not replicated in other cohorts; however, knockdown of this gene in Drosophila results in lack of sleep during the first 3 hours of the night. To date, no replicated associations between common genetic variants and sleep duration (or other sleep parameters) have been reported from GWAS studies. In the present study, we utilize self-report data on usual sleep duration, collected by 18 community-based cohort studies that have genotyped their cohorts, in order to identify common genetic variants associated with sleep duration. This study comprises a community-based sample of 47 180 individuals, approximately 10-fold larger than all previously reported GWAS studies of this phenotype, and is the first to show replication in an independent sample.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 3844, "infons": {"section_type": "METHODS", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "METHODS", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 3852, "infons": {"section_type": "METHODS", "type": "title_2"}, "text": "Cohorts", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 3860, "infons": {"section_type": "METHODS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Participating cohorts were prospective studies that had collected self-report data on usual sleep duration.

The relation between self-reported usual sleep duration and calculated time in bed was assessed in 9400 participants in the ARIC, CHS and FHS cohorts with data for both measures.

PAX8 is a well-characterized transcription factor essential to the formation of thyroxine-producing follicular cells during thyroid development. PAX8 mutations produce thyroid dysgenesis, but the transcription factor is more widely expressed and may have other functions. In contrast, CBWD2 is a poorly characterized gene highly expressed in the brain. The intergenic region also overlies a poorly characterized, predicted non-coding RNA (LOC101927400).

A lookup of these SNPs in the Meta-Thyroid consortium analysis of over 20,000 individuals of European ancestry found no evidence for association of any of these SNPs with blood levels of either thyroid stimulating hormone or free thyroxine. The SNP rs1191685 is significantly associated with differential expression in skin of a transcript of IL1RN (p=3.30 x 10-5), which encodes the interleukin-1 receptor antagonist. This eQTL signal peaks at rs1191683, which is in high LD with rs1191685 (r2=0.80); a signal was not seen in a smaller skin eQTL dataset. Because of a strong association of short sleep duration with diabetes mellitus and other glycemic traits, we performed a look-up of these SNPs in published GWAS analyses of these traits. Three of the SNPs (rs1807282, rs1823125, rs1964463) showed nominally significant association with the homeostatic model assessment of beta cell function (HOMA-beta, p=0.04,) and with glycated hemoglobin (HgbA1C, p=0.008 to 0.011,). In each case, the minor allele, which is associated with longer sleep duration, is associated with a more favorable metabolic profile, i.e., higher HOMA-beta and lower HgbA1C. No association of these SNPs with Type 2 diabetes mellitus was present in data from the DIAGRAM consortium (DIAGRAMv3.2012DEC17).

These SNPs are also in perfect linkage disequilibrium with two SNPs (rs4713380 and rs4713385) that are significantly associated with the expression in peripheral whole blood of transcripts of the genes IER3 (p=8.40 x 10-23), FLOT1 (p=4.00 x 10-17), VARS2 (p=4.60 x 10-12) and TUBB (p=4.20 x 10-5), and in both skin (p=1.60 x 10-9) and B-lymphoblastoid cell lines (p=6.49 x 10-5) with expression of IER3. A lookup in the PGC cross-disorder GWAS, which analyzed the association of genotype jointly with five psychiatric disorders (ADHD, autism spectrum disorders, bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder and schizophrenia), indicated that the three SNPs on chromosome 6 that are associated with sleep duration are significantly associated with psychiatric disorders (p=0.0003 to 0.001). These SNPs are part of a LD block spanning approximately 30,000 bp, and are in complete LD (r2=1.0) with 10 additional SNPs in this block, each of which is associated with the psychiatric disorders at p=4.7-9.9 x 10-5. This association was driven by associations with major depressive disorder (p=0.02 to 0.05) and schizophrenia (p=0.04 to 0.08). In each case, the allele associated with shorter sleep duration in the present analysis was associated with increased depression and schizophrenia risk in the PGC analyses. Notwithstanding these suggestive correlates, this region did not replicate in the African-American sample. The effect was in the same direction but somewhat smaller (2.2 - 2.6 minutes less sleep per night per copy of the minor allele), and not statistically significant (lowest p=0.39), although given a MAF of 0.09-0.10, the power to detect a significant replication of an effect of the magnitude seen in the discovery sample was low (range 17-18%).", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 21470, "infons": {"section_type": "RESULTS", "type": "title_2"}, "text": "Additional novel sleep duration loci and evaluation of candidate genes", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 21541, "infons": {"section_type": "RESULTS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "An additional 11 loci were associated with usual sleep duration in the GWAS of the discovery cohorts at a nominal p <10-5 (Table 4); none was significantly associated with sleep duration in the replication cohort, albeit with low power to detect significant effects (power <30% for each locus). A number of genes have been associated with sleep duration or chronotype through smaller candidate gene or GWAS studies that had no overlap with the cohorts included in the present study. The present GWAS included multiple SNPs in these genes and other core mammalian clock genes, including ABCC9 (131 SNPs), PER2 (22 SNPs), PER3 (56 SNPs), CLOCK (110 SNPs), ARNTL (114 SNPs), ARNTL2 (106 SNPs), and CSNK1D (6 SNPs). No SNPs in BHLHE41 were present in the GWAS. There was no evidence for association at any of these SNPs with usual sleep duration, using a liberal threshold of p<0.01. The SNP rs12649507 in CLOCK, previously reported to be associated with usual sleep duration with an effect size of approximately 5 minutes shorter sleep per night in homozygotes for the minor allele than in homozygotes for the major allele, had a smaller estimated effect in the present study of 0.9 minutes shorter sleep per night per copy of the minor allele (p=0.03). The SNP rs11046205 in ABCC9, previously reported to be associated with usual sleep duration with an effect size of approximately 10 minutes longer sleep per night per copy of the minor allele, had an estimated effect in the present analysis of only 0.9 minutes longer sleep per night per copy of the minor allele (p=0.11).", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 23117, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "DISCUSSION", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 23128, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "This genome-wide association study identified two loci with genome-wide significant age- and sex-adjusted association to self-reported usual sleep duration in a large, multi-national sample of adults from Europe or of European descent. One of these loci was replicated in a sample of African-Americans, strengthening the finding. This first locus is located approximately 30-80 kb upstream from the thyroid-specific transcription factor PAX8 and, at a somewhat greater distance, upstream from CBWD2. It also overlies a predicted non-coding RNA LOC101927400 and is approximately 200 kb from an interleukin-1 gene cluster. While little is known about the function of CBWD2, PAX8 is a transcription factor that is most highly expressed in thyroid tissue, where it is important both in thyroid development and in maintaining adult thyroid function. Thyroid-stimulating hormone levels are reduced by sleep deprivation, with both higher and lower free thyroxine levels reported. Hypothyroidism is associated with excessive sleepiness and with reductions in slow-wave sleep that can be corrected with hormone replacement, while hyperthyroidism is associated with insomnia. These findings suggest a role for thyroid hormone in sleep-wake regulation and thus a plausible role for PAX8 effects on sleep duration. The locus of interest is in the vicinity of an enhancer that is associated with an in vitro increase in PAX8 gene expression of up to 250-fold. As no thyroid-specific eQTL databases are available, and PAX8 is expressed in adults primarily in the thyroid gland, it was not possible to assess whether these variants are associated with changes in PAX8 expression; however, these SNPs were not associated with measures of thyroid function in a genome-wide association study, albeit in a smaller sample. An alternative possibility is suggested by the association of rs1191685 with expression of IL1RN, as its product, the interleukin-1 receptor antagonist, has been shown to block the somnogenic effect of interleukin-1, which is hypothesized to be involved in the physiologic regulation of sleep. The IL1RN is located 100 kb downstream of PAX8 and a regulatory element for this receptor could be distantly located between PAX8 and CBWD2 (Fig.1). Although the mechanisms discussed above remain speculative, the cross-racial replication of the association suggests a true effect of this locus on usual sleep duration.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 25544, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "While the magnitude of the association of the SNPs upstream of PAX8 with sleep duration appears modest, with each copy of the minor allele associated with an estimated increase in usual sleep duration of approximately 3 minutes per night, the 0.07% of variance in sleep duration explained by this variant is typical of GWAS studies. For example, of 32 loci showing genome-wide significant association with body mass index in the GIANT Consortium analysis of almost 250 000 individuals, only four explained greater than 0.07% of the variance in body mass index, with the two most strongly associated loci (FTO and TMEM18) explaining 0.34% and 0.15% of variance, respectively, and the remaining 30 variants explaining an average of 0.03% of variance each. Moreover, self-reported usual sleep duration is likely to be an imprecise correlate of the underlying biological construct of interest, which is the innate sleep period of the individual free of environmental constraints. This reflects both technical factors, including imprecision in self-report estimates of sleep duration compared to objective measures such as actigraphy and the coarse-grained response options typical of sleep duration questionnaires, as well as extensive socio-environmental influences on sleep behaviors, including the widespread consumption of caffeine and alcohol, the impact of medical and psychiatric illness on sleep, and most importantly the impact of work and social schedules that are often unrelated to individual differences in optimal sleep duration. In older individuals, retirement from work and lack of childrearing responsibility often reduce the impact of social demands on sleep schedule, perhaps explaining the stronger effect observed in the older cohorts included in this analysis.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 27324, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Although the present study is more than 10-fold larger than the two previously published GWAS studies of sleep duration, it remains small compared to recent studies of traits such as body mass index and hypertension, which are more widely available in large population-based cohorts. The replicated locus upstream from PAX8 is therefore likely to represent the first of a larger number of associations that will appear as future population-based GWAS studies of sleep duration benefit from more rigorous phenotyping and larger sample size. Self-reported short sleep duration and experimental sleep restriction are strongly associated with impaired glucose metabolism. Sleep disturbance and short sleep duration are also common in psychiatric disorders, including ADHD. It is therefore of interest that the alleles upstream from PAX8 that are associated with longer sleep duration in this study were in prior GWAS studies associated with higher HOMA-beta and lower HgbA1C and with lower ADHD risk. As sleep duration is associated with other important illnesses, including incident post-traumatic stress disorder, obesity, hypertension, and coronary heart disease, as well as with mortality, elucidating the molecular pathways that regulate sleep duration may both identify novel mechanisms affecting sleep regulation and help to explain its association with psychiatric and cardiometabolic
