Across the genome, 52 independent loci, 32 of which are novel, reached genome-wide significance for association with 1 or more QRS phenotypes (Figure 1, Online Figure 2, Online Table 3, Online Appendix). At each locus, we defined a single \"sentinel\" SNP with the lowest p value against any of the 4 phenotypes; regional association plots for the 52 loci are shown in Online Figure 3. Among the 52 loci, 32 were associated with only 1 QRS phenotype, and 20 with at least 2 phenotypes (Online Figure 4). The total number of locus-phenotype associations at p < 10-8 was 79 (72 SNPs), of which 59 are novel (Online Table 3).

In an analysis across 349 diverse cell lines, cultured primary cells, and fetal tissues mapped by the ENCODE project and the National Institute of Health Roadmap Epigenomics Program, the majority (42 of 52) of sentinel SNPs were located in DHS. In human fetal heart tissue, we found that less than one-half (22 of 52) overlapped DHS, which still represents a ~3.5-fold enrichment compared with the null expectation (p = 7.7 x 10-12) (Figure 2A). Further, the enrichment of genome-wide significant SNPs (p < 10-8) in DHS was strongest within the first 100 base pairs around the sentinel variants (Figure 2B). Additionally, there was a strong enrichment for histone marks and chromatin states associated with active enhancers, promoters, and transcription in the human heart; by contrast, no enrichment was observed for transcriptionally repressive histone marks or states (Figures 2C and 2D, Online Figure 5). Strikingly, we observed increasing enrichment of activating histone marks at the identified QRS loci during the process of differentiating mouse embryonic stem cells into cardiomyocytes (Online Figure 6).

When considering all genome-wide significant SNPs (p < 10-8) as well as those in high LD (r2 > 0.8), 402 SNPs in the colocalizing DHS perturb transcription recognition sequences, including those of important cardiac and muscle developmental regulators like TBX, GATA-4, and MEF2. When we intersected the GWAS results with ChIP-seq data from mouse and human cardiac tissue, we found enrichment in enhancers marked by p300, sites bound by RNA polymerase II, and the transcription factors NKX2-5, GATA-4, TBX3, TBX5, and SRF (Figure 2E). A total of 9 of our 52 loci contained not only fetal heart DHS but also ChIP-seq-validated TF binding sites. SNPs overlapping TF binding sites were 5.65-fold enriched within DHS (p = 9.0 x 10-10) but not outside of the DHS (p =0.20). The associations of the 52 sentinel SNPs with all tested functional elements are summarized in Figure 1. We validated several candidate regulatory regions identified earlier as heart enhancers in vivo. Activity of 4 exemplar novel human cardiac enhancers in embryonic transgenic mice stained for LacZ enhancer reporter activity are shown in Figure 3A. Recently, rs6801957 (Figure 1) in the SCN5A/SCN10A locus was reported to influence the activity of a regulatory element affecting SCN5A expression. Conditional analysis (Online Table 8) revealed that rs6781009 (at 180 kb from the sentinel) is an additional novel independent signal at this locus.

Among these genes, we prioritized potential candidates using an established complementary strategy by choosing: 1) genes nearest to the sentinel SNP and any other genes within 10 kb (56 genes) (Figure 1); 2) genes containing a nonsynonymous SNP in high LD (r2 > 0.8) with the sentinel SNP (11 genes) (Online Table 10); 3) protein-coding genes with cis-eQTL associated with sentinel SNP (14 genes) (Online Table 12); and 4) GRAIL analysis of the published data (16 genes) (Online Table 13) with \"cardiac,\" \"muscle,\" and \"heart\" as the top 3 keywords describing the observed functional connections. In total, this strategy identified 67 candidate genes at the 52 loci (Figure 1). Pathway analysis confirmed that the list of 67 candidate genes is strongly enriched for genes known to be involved in cardiovascular and muscular system development and function (p = 1 x 10-56) (Online Tables 14 and 15). We have summarized the available functional annotations for all 67 candidates in Online Table 16, including established links from the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man between candidate genes and familial cardiomyopathies (TNNT2, TTN, PLN, and MYBPC3) and cardiac arrhythmias (CASQ2).

On average, expression levels for these transcripts were higher in cardiac-derived samples compared with other transcripts in the same sample (p = 9.8 x 10-6 for heart tissue; Wilcoxon test) (Online Figure 7) and also when compared to the same transcripts in other tissues (p = 0.005 after Bonferroni correction) (Online Figure 8). To further investigate the potential role of these candidate genes in cardiac development, we assessed temporal gene expression patterns during in vitro differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells via mesoderm and cardiac precursor cells to cardiomyocytes. A total of 7% of genes are mainly expressed during the embryonic stem cell stage, 22% during the mesoderm stage, 7% in the cardiac precursor stage, and 64% in the cardiomyocyte stage. Compared with other genes, the candidate genes were more highly expressed in cardiomyocytes (p = 5.4 x 10-8; Wilcoxon test) (Online Figure 9).

To illustrate that prioritized genes may play a critical role in heart development, we tested 4 (CG4743/SLC25A26, Fhos/FHOD3, Cka/STRN, and NACalpha/NACA) of these 9 genes with unknown cardiac function by performing heart-specific RNAi knockdown with the cardiac Hand4.2-Gal4 driver line. We also retested EcR/NR1H, which has multiple homologous genes in mammals, as well as Hand/HAND1, as this gene was only tested as a full-knockout in early development but not in the adult D. melanogaster heart using cardiac-specific knockdown. Adult hearts of Cka/STRN, NACalpha/NACA, and EcR/NR1H RNAi showed severe cardiac defects (Figure 4). Knockdown of Hand/HAND1 and Cka/STRN both had a reduced cardiac heart rate. We also expanded on gene-by-gene analysis and identified 6 further genes causing cardiac abnormalities (Online Appendix, Online Table 17). From the Mouse Genome Informatics database, knockout models were annotated for 45 orthologues of the 67 candidate genes, of which 18 (40%) revealed a cardiac phenotype (Online Table 16). This represents a 5.2-fold enrichment compared with randomly matched sets of 67 genes (p = 3.4 x 10-14) (Online Figure 10).

In addition to MYBPC3, eQTL and histone modification data also suggest a potential role for NR1H3 (Online Figure 11), as decreased expression of NR1H3 was associated with higher QRS voltages. However, NR1H3-deficient mice do not spontaneously develop a cardiac hypertrophic phenotype (MGI: 1352462). To study the potential cardiac effects of NR1H3, we created a transgenic mouse with cardiac-specific overexpression of NR1H3 under the control of the Myh6 promoter and found a diminished susceptibility to perturbations such as transverse aortic constriction and angiotensin II infusion that provoke cardiac hypertrophy. This observation is in line with protective effects due to treatment with T0901317, a synthetic NR1H3 agonist, in mice challenged with aortic constriction.

The abundance of candidate genes known to be involved in cardiac muscle function strengthens the hypothesis that the easily obtainable QRS-voltage phenotypes of the ECG are effective in capturing unknown loci that harbor genes likely to play an important role in left ventricular mass, but these are currently not well understood.

In 1 of our loci, we identified a very strong candidate gene (MYBPC3) that is well known to be involved in hypertrophic cardiomyopathies.

The regulatory element is bound by TBX3, TBX5, and P300 (lower black traces) in mice, and the contact profile of the SCN5A promoter obtained by 4C-seq human cardiac ventricular tissue revealed an interaction between this regulatory element and the SCN5A promoter (upper black trace and contact profile). Normalized contact intensities (gray dots) and their running median trends (black line) are depicted for the SCN5A promoter viewpoint.
