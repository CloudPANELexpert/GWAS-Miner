In somatic cells TL progressively shortens with each mitotic division due to the inability of DNA polymerase to fully replicate the 3' end of the DNA strand. Cellular senescence and subsequent death often occurs when the mean TL reaches a critical value. Shorter mean leukocyte TL has been shown to be associated with risk of several age-related diseases and proposed as a marker of biological ageing. Maintenance of TL is required in certain cell types (e.g. germ cells) and this is achieved by telomerase, a ribonucleoprotein consisting of a reverse transcriptase (TERT) and a RNA template (TERC) that facilitates addition of the telomere repeat sequence.

Further details of the cohorts and genotyping are given in Supplementary Methods and Supplementary Table 1.

TL was measured in these subjects using a variation of the PCR-based method used in the discovery and GRAPHIC cohorts (see Supplementary Methods). Both rs16847897 and rs12696304 again showed significant associations with TL (Table 1). To assess the totality of the evidence for the association of the chromosome 3q26 locus with TL, we used Fisher's method (see Supplementary Methods).

wide association studies (GWAS) and taken through to replication in the GRAPHIC study and subsequently for rs12696304 and rs16847897 into the TwinsUK and PREVEND studies. The minor allele frequency (MAF), beta coefficient (Beta), standard error (SE) and the P value for association for each cohort individually and for the combined analysis of the BHF-FHS and UKBS subjects are shown. SNP associations were analysed using an additive model. The beta coefficients equate to the mean change in telomere length for the particular measure of telomere length (T/S ratio in BHF-FHS, UKBS, GRAPHIC and PREVEND and Southern blot determined telomere length in TwinsUK) per copy of the minor allele for the specific SNP. A negative beta indicates a shorter mean telomere in those carrying the minor allele.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}], "annotations": [], "relations": []}]}
