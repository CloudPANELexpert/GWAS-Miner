DPP10 is moderately expressed in the trachea; however, it is abundantly expressed in nodose and dorsal root ganglia, suggesting a possible role in controlling bronchial reactivity due to alterations in the magnitude of the A-type K+ current and subsequent changes in the excitability of cell membranes. Importantly, it has been well-established that perturbations and perversions of afferent nerve function contribute to manifestations associated with inflammatory airway disease. Consistent with these findings, QTL studies on murine models have linked airway hyper-responsiveness in mice to the mouse homolog of human DPP10 .

The DPP10 gene is substantial in size, extending over 1 Mb of genomic DNA. Allen et al. genotyped a limited number of SNPs with a focus primarily around the initial few exons of the gene.

However, the fact that GWAS has only identified a modest number of common variants of relatively modest effect supports the notion that numerous rare functional SNPs are major contributors to susceptibility to common diseases, such as asthma. Although it is estimated that ~60% of SNPs in the human genome have MAF<5%, companies producing GWAS arrays are biased towards common tagging variants in support of the common-disease common-variant (CDCV) hypothesis and, consequently, there are relatively few rare SNPs in coding and promoter regions in their SNP genotyping panels. Of greater concern in the context of the current study, it has been demonstrated that currently available commercial chips, including the panel used in the GRAAD discovery population, are inadequate in content for African-origin populations. These findings also underscore the shortcoming of relying only upon Yoruban genomes (i.e., YRI) to represent African Americans, particularly in light of the recent observations by Tishkoff and colleagues demonstrating that, although ~71% of the African ancestry of African Americans can be attributed to West African populations, other African groups account for at least 8% of the African ancestry.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 36073, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "A possible explanation for the failure to observe SNP-for-SNP replication in the four independent African ancestry populations is subtle differences in admixture across each of the samples.
