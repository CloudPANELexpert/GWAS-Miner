prognostic factors have been identified associated with survival in patients with osteosarcoma. The authors conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of overall survival in two sets of patients with osteosarcoma. They identified a common single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), rs55933544, located in the GLDC gene on chromosome 9, associated with poor survival. The rs55933544 risk allele was associated with lower expression of the nearby gene, IL33. These findings, if replicated in additional populations, form the foundation for future studies of the molecular basis of the association of the GLDC/IL33 (rs55933544) variant with survival in osteosarcoma.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}], "annotations": [], "relations": []}]}
