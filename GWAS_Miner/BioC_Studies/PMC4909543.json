Deleterious germline mutations in these genes, however, account for less than 5% of CRC cases in the population.

The T allele of rs11064437 changes the splice site from TC (canonical site AG on the reverse strand) to TT, and is predicted to disrupt the splicing and introduce a transcriptional isoform with a shortened untranslated region at exon 2 (Supplementary Figure 3). Using data in colon tumor tissues from TCGA, we found a suggestive association of the T allele of rs11064437 with the relative abundance of this isoform (P = 0.11, Supplementary Figure 4). In addition, some of the highly correlated variants were mapped to an active promoter region of SPSB2 in normal colorectal cells (Supplementary Figure 2). These findings, together with results from the eQTL analysis in CRC patients, suggested that variants at 12p13.3 might contribute to CRC risk by regulating the expression of SPSB2. Previous studies have shown that alternative splicing of untranslated regions of exons can affect the stability and translation efficiency of pre-mRNAs. Similarly, it is possible that rs11064437 may affect post-transcriptional regulation of SPSB2. Misregulated pre-mRNA splicing, which produces aberrant isoforms, has been found to contribute to tumorigenesis. Therefore, rs11064437 may be one of the causal variants for the association observed at this locus. Future experiments evaluating SPSB2 splicing diversity and its relevance for the observed association are needed to elucidate the role of this variant. SPSB2 encodes a protein with a suppressor of cytokine signaling domain that functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase and a SPRY domain that recognizes substrate for ubiquitination and degradation. This protein is predicted to regulate the expression of interacting proteins by targeting them for ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation. For example, SPSB2 specifically interacts with the inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), promotes its degradation and decreases the NO production. Selective inhibitors of iNOS have been proposed for chemoprevention of CRC. Nonetheless, there were other potential target genes at this locus, such as ENO2, CDCA3 and USP5 (Supplementary Table 7).", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 23246, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "At 6p21.1, rs4711689 lies in intron 6 of TFEB. This SNP and its highly correlated SNPs were mapped to a region with enhancer activities in normal colorectal tissues (Supplementary Figure 2). Using enhancer-promoter interaction data derived by the FANTOM5 project, we identified TFEB as a potential target gene (enhancer near rs4711689 (chr6:41672431-41703298) and TFEB expression pairwise correlation r =0.33, FDR < 2.2 x10-16). Together with the eQTL analysis at this locus, we proposed that TFEB was a likely candidate gene at this locus. TFEB encodes a basic helix-loop helix leucine zipper transcription factor, which has been found to be oncogenic for melanoma, renal cell carcinoma and some sarcomas. However, the role of TFEB in CRC is unknown. Recent studies have shown that this gene is a master regulator of the autophagy-lysosome pathway and of energy metabolism. Deregulated autophagy has been linked to cancer initiation and progression. These pieces of evidence further support our hypothesis that TFEB is the likely candidate gene at this locus. Notably, TFEB activation is regulated by mTORC1 signaling, which is thought to be one of the fundamental mechanisms for sustaining tumor growth in CRC. It is possible that TFEB may contribute to CRC risk, at least in part, by mediating downstream effects of the mTORC1 pathways.

Epidemiological studies suggest that steroid hormones may be associated with risk of CRC and other cancers. Thought to affect steroid hormone levels, CYP17A1 variants, particularly promoter variant rs743572, have been extensively studied in association with risk of hormone-related cancers;  however, the results were very inconsistent.

Thus, it is likely that some of these variants might be involved in the transcriptional regulation of EIF3H. Together with the evidence from the eQTL analysis, we identified EIF3H as a likely target gene for variants at this locus. EIF3H encodes a subunit of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3. An oncogenic role of this gene was demonstrated by its ability to transform NIH-3T3 cells into their malignant forms. Recent studies have shown that EIF3H promoted cancer cell growth by stimulating protein synthesis. Another possible candidate gene at this locus is RAD21 (Supplementary Figure 2), which encodes a subunit of cohesin that involves chromosome segregation and DNA repair.

In line with evidence from eQTL analysis, these epigenomic data supported the hypothesis that RPS21 was the likely target gene. RPS21 encodes a ribosomal protein that is a component of the 40S subunit of ribosomes. However, its role in tumorigenesis remains unclear. A recent study that characterized differences in eQTLs between tumor and matched normal colon tissues showed that RPS21 had a significantly higher allelic-specific expression somatic event rate and suggested that this gene was a potential driver in CRC.
