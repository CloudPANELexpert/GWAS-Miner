We included a few white Hispanics and adjusted for population structure. Since only one of the CHARGE studies, CHS, had a small number of African American participants (n=574 with genotyping) this racial subgroup was too small for independent analysis. Linkage disequilibrium patterns are very different in African persons and this leads to greater uncertainty in imputation, as well as the possibility of false positive associations if data from two racial groups are combined when disease risk differs by race (a phenomenon called population stratification), hence African-American participants in the CHS study were excluded from these analyses. Each study fit an additive genetic model - a 1 degree of freedom trend test - relating genotype dosage (0 to 2 copies of the minor allele) to study trait. In the CHARGE cohorts, prevalent cases were compared to controls free of dementia at the DNA draw date. Participants were excluded if they declined consent or failed genotyping. For analysis of prevalent events in the CHARGE cohorts and for the case-control data from TGEN and Mayo we used logistic regression models. For the analysis of incident events in the CHARGE cohorts, participants who were free of dementia entered the analysis at the time of the DNA sample collection and were followed until the development of incident AD; participants were censored at death, at the time of their last follow-up examination or health status update when they were known to be free of clinical dementia, and when they developed dementia due to an alternate cause. We used Cox proportional hazards models to calculate hazard ratios with corresponding 95% confidence intervals after ensuring that assumptions of proportionality of hazards were met. In CHS, FHS, and the Rotterdam Study controls contributed one set of person-years to the prevalent analysis and a second, non-overlapping set of person-years to the incident analyses.

The improvement in risk prediction was investigated by comparing three sequentially incremental AD risk prediction models that first incorporated age- and sex- alone, and then added data on risk allele status at the APOE, and finally risk allele status at the CLU and PICALM loci. We did not assess the utility of novel loci uncovered in this paper (using CHARGE as part of the discovery sample) to avoid the risk of overestimating effects by using the same sample for gene discovery and risk prediction.

We note that BIN1 was previously identified as showing suggestive association with AD in the recent GWAS from the GERAD1; our study now finds the association for the first time to be genome-wide significant, which is a major step forward. Furthermore, we replicated both these loci as well as the recently identified loci, CLU and PICALM in an independent sample. Although genetic variation at the CLU and PICALM loci did modify the risk of AD in our population-based sample, and their discovery represents a significant advance in understanding the pathophysiology of AD, these polymorphisms had a very limited impact on prediction of AD risk.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 23029, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The locus on chromosome 2q14.3 is adjacent to the bridging integrator 1 (BIN1) gene, which is one of two amphiphysins, and is expressed most abundantly in the brain and muscle.

The protein product of BLOC1S3, called 'Biogenesis of lysosomal organelles complex-1, subunit 3' is expressed in the brain, regulates endosomal to lysosomal routing, and has been implicated in schizophrenia. The second gene, MARK4 or MAP/microtubule affinity-regulating kinase 4, is inducible, expressed only in the brain, and plays a role in neuronal differentiation. MARK4 is a kinase that phosphorylates tau, is polyubiquitinated in vivo, and is a substrate of the aging-related deubiquitinating enzyme USP9X; hence it may play a role in the abnormal tau phosphorylation seen in AD.

There are two reasons for this. First, the associations of CLU and PICALM with AD risk were markedly lower than those of age and APOE, and therefore a major improvement was not expected. This fits with recent insights on polygenic models that assume there are 10,000s of risk alleles, each with a small (~5% increase in relative risk) effect throughout the whole genome, rather than a discrete number of alleles with moderate effects. Such models appear to underlie the susceptibility to schizophrenia risk and a similar model may be applicable to AD. Second, the extent to which risk factors improve risk prediction depends on the predictive performance of the initial risk model. Added risk factors need to have stronger effects to improve a risk model with high AUC than to improve a model with lower AUC. AD risk prediction based on age, sex and APOE already has very high discriminative accuracy, the AUC was 0.826 in the Rotterdam Study and 0.670 in CHS, which implies that further improvements require many new variants or variants with strong effects. Whether such improvements are to be expected will depend for a large part on our ability to unravel the underlying genetic architecture and to identify and quantify environmental risk factors, including complex interactions.
