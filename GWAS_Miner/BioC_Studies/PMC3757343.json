A previous study, which did not control for the association of ERAP1 with ankylosing spondylitis, observed no association of an ERAP2 loss-of-function variant with ankylosing spondylitis. Other studies have identified associations with ERAP2 but have not dissected them from the known associations of ERAP1 SNPs. Here, controlling for the association of ERAP1 with ankylosing spondylitis, two functionally important SNPs in ERAP2 were found to be associated with ankylosing spondylitis: rs2549782, which leads to a change in ERAP2 catalytic activity, and rs2248374, where the protective G allele causes complete loss of ERAP2 mRNA and absence of ERAP2 protein. In the European samples, controlling for the association with ERAP1, we identified SNPs in ERAP2 and LNPEP that were associated with ankylosing spondylitis (lead SNP, rs2910686: OR = 1.2, P = 4.5 x 10-17; Supplementary Fig. 3b). Because the association of ERAP1 variants was restricted to HLA-B*27-positive ankylosing spondylitis, analyzing ERAP2 and LNPEP SNPs in HLA-B*27-negative cases and controls produced similar results to analyses of the combined (HLA-B*27-positive and HLA-B*27-negative) cases and controls when the association with ERAP1 was controlled for.

Common TYK2 variants are also associated with Crohn's disease and psoriasis. A different, rare TYK2 variant, rs34536443, is associated with multiple sclerosis. IL-6 signaling through IL-6R has diverse proinflammatory effects. In combination with transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta, it influences the ratio of TH17 to regulatory T (Treg) cells, promoting the differentiation of TH17 cells from naive T cells and inhibiting TGF-beta-induced differentiation into Treg cells. Previous studies have reported no increase in TH17 lymphocyte counts in ankylosing spondylitis, suggesting that the IL6R association with ankylosing spondylitis operates through mechanisms other than effects on TH17 lymphocytes. Whether IL-6 has a role in the differentiation or activation of non-canonical cellular sources of IL-17 such as gammadelta T cells, NK cells, neutrophils and mast cells, which have been implicated in ankylosing spondylitis, is unclear. IL-27 potentiates the differentiation of CD4+ TH1 cells, while suppressing the differentiation of T helper 2 (TH2) and TH17 cells.

EOMES encodes eomesodermin, a transcription factor involved in CD8+ T cell differentiation whose expression is induced by RUNX3. Where eomesodermin is deficient, CD8+ T cells have been shown to express IL-17. IL-7 acts through IL-7R to induce RUNX3 expression in developing T cells, in turn favoring differentiation toward the CD8+ T cell lineage. ZMIZ1 is a transcriptional coactivator of the protein inhibitor of activated STAT (PIAS)-like family and thus may have effects on STAT-mediated cytokine signaling. ZMIZ1 has recently been shown to cooperate with activating NOTCH1 mutations in inducing T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, consistent with it having a role in T cell differentiation. Whether these genes affect risk of ankylosing spondylitis directly through effects on CD8+ T cell differentiation is unclear. For example, although the risk haplotype at RUNX3 is associated with lower CD8+ T cell counts, at IL7R, the opposite phenotype is observed, suggesting that the mechanisms involved are more complex than a simple effect on CD8+ T cell counts.

It is possible that these genes operate in ankylosing spondylitis through a quantitative effect on HLA class I peptide presentation or a qualitative effect on the peptide repertoire presented. Downregulation of ERAP1 and ERAP2 expression has been shown to reduce cell surface expression of HLA class I molecules. ERAP1 preferentially cleaves hydrophobic amino acids, whereas ERAP2 preferentially cleaves basic residues. ERAP1-ERAP2 heterodimers may thus act in concert, particularly in cleaving longer peptides. It has been suggested that misfolding of nascent HLA-B*27 in the ER, leading to ER stress, may be involved in the pathogenesis of ankylosing spondylitis.

The current study shows that there are two signals at this locus, one in TNFRSF1A and the other in LTBR.

The resulting protein acts as a soluble decoy receptor for TNF, akin to the TNF inhibitor drug etanercept.

Cells were rested in RPMI supplemented with 10% FBS for approximately 1 h at 37  C at 5% CO2 before further use. Cells were stained with CD3 ECD (UCHT1, Beckman Coulter) and CD4 Pacific Blue (13B8.2, Beckman Coulter). Antibodies were used at final dilutions of 1:100 of antibody stocks. Dead cells were excluded using a Live/Dead Fixable Dead Cell Stain kit (Invitrogen).
