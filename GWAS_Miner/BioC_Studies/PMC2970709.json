This is the first GWAS using this phenotype, and to the best of our knowledge, the first GWAS in any sample of patients with information regarding migraine headaches. We here report a finding on chromosome 13q14.1 characterizing the patients with BPAD and comorbid migraine. The region counted 9 SNPs with p-values < 10 x 10-5 (chr13:41192397-41388566), including two SNPs with p-values, approaching genome-wide significance (5x10-8). This finding was however considerably weaker when analyses were repeated using the Fisher's Exact test which is more robust to small cell counts. In order to further qualify our most interesting result, we therefore performed a successful replication analyses in a sample of patients with ADHD and comorbid migraine. This replication analyses included only the most significant SNP from the primary analyses (rs9566845), and the analyses demonstrated a 2.4 fold increase of the rare allele among ADHD patients with migraine headache (p=0.013). Interestingly, the region of association harbours an uncharacterized gene (KIAA0564; chr13:41191473-41433221). Little is known about the gene which has a complex structure with several putative transcripts. The longest transcript consists of 45 exons and is estimated to encode a protein of 1905 amino acids with putative ATPase activity. The expression pattern appears to vary between transcripts, for example one transcript which is encoded by 26 exons (NM_001009814) shows a particularly interesting pattern of expression (found in cDNA clones from whole brain, substantia nigra, amygdala, hypothalamus etc). It is also possible that the associated variant act as a regulator of other nearby genes. Recently, a genome-wide Dutch migraine linkage study reported linkage to a genomic region in close proximity the region of association in the current study, giving further support that this genomic region could be implicated in migraine headaches. In the Dutch study a broad peak covering a wide area of chromosome 13 with a maximum LOD score of 1.63 was identified. However, the subtype with pulsating headache produced even higher LOD scores (LOD > 2 from 40-100cM), encompassing the region enclosing the KIAA 0564 gene. Also a genome-wide linkage screen of 13 bipolar affective disorder pedigrees has provided evidence for susceptibility on chromosome 13q14 (LOD score of 2.29 at marker D13S153) in close proximity to KIAA0564). The gene KIAA0564 has putative ATPase activity expressed in the brain, as seen in patients with familial hemiplegic migraine (FHM II), where are found mutations in ATP1A2 which encodes the 2 subunit of Na+/K+ ATPases that are expressed in astrocytes in the adult brain. In this regard, it is interesting that the gene identified to cause familial hemiplegic migraine (FHM I), CACNA1A), has overlapping functional similarities to CACNA1C, a gene that was recently associated with bipolar disorder in a collaborative genome-wide association analysis of 4387 cases.

Although headache in this prescription study may have been related to the intake of psycho-stimulants, the figures are still in line with the data from the current study where the prevalence of migraine in the ADHD sample was 28.6 %.
