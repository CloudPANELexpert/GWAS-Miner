These proteins are secreted agonists of the canonical Wnt/beta (beta)-catenin signalling pathway. They activate the pathway leading to induced transcription of Wnt target genes. Wnt/beta-catenin signalling plays a central role in embryogenesis, organogenesis and adult homeostasis and is a critical regulator of stem cell maintenance. RSPO3 is a ligand of the Frizzled 8 and LRP5/6 receptors. In the canonical form of the Wnt pathway, binding of ligands to the Frizzled receptor and LRP5 or 6 coreceptors causes beta-catenin to dephosphorylate in the cytoplasm. Accumulated beta-catenin translocates to the nucleus where it binds to T cell factor/Lymphoid enhancer-binding factor, causing transcription of Wnt target genes:such as Fibronectin, MMP-7, Twist and Snail. These factors activate hepatic stellate cells and induce liver fibrosis. Blocking the Wnt signalling pathway using Dickkopf-1, a Wnt coreceptor antagonist, restores hepatic stellate cells quiescence in culture. Hence, Wnt signalling is involved in both progression and regression of liver fibrosis, either by inhibiting or promoting activation and survival of hepatic stellate cells. Also, RSPOs have been shown to facilitate hepatic stellate cell activation and promote hepatic fibrogenesis. Here, we demonstrate that RSPO3 is expressed in key effector cells involved in the pathogenesis of PSC. Since we have shown that patients with PSC that are homozygote AA carriers of rs853974 progress more rapidly towards PSC-related death or liver transplantation, RSPO3 can be regarded a plausible candidate gene to be involved in PSC disease progression. Hypothetically, patients with PSC might benefit from reduction of RSPO3 or generally canonical Wnt signalling.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 20636, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "In an immunochip analysis of the International IBD Genetics Consortium including over 75 000 individuals, an intronic SNP rs9491697 in RSPO3 (which is not in linkage disequilibrium with rs853974, r2=0.014) was identified to be associated with Crohn's disease (p=3.79x10-10, OR=1.077) but not with UC. Given the small number of patients with Crohn's disease (n=357) within the present study, the lack of linkage disequilibrium between the two 'hit SNPs' and the fact that our multivariate Cox model corrected for IBD-status, the identified association signal does not seem to be driven by the co-occurrence of Crohn's disease in our cohort.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 21289, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "For several binary and time-to-event subphenotypes, we found suggestive genetic associations.

Furthermore, one SNP, rs7731017, was suggestively associated with the presence of CCA. We investigated whether any of the candidate genes in the locus overlapped with genes identified in tumour sequencing studies of CCA. We did not find an overlap with the 32 genes reported to be significantly altered in intrahepatic, extrahepatic and gallbladder cancer by Nakamura et al. When comparing the genes in our CCA locus with 1146 genes containing non-synonymous somatic mutations in intrahepatic CCA, we found that the SYNPO gene was both in the list of 1146 genes of the sequencing study as well as in the locus that we identified to be associated with the presence of CCA. There is little known about this gene and there is no connection with oncogenesis. Another gene, SP100, was found in this study to be in the locus associated with time to CCA and is also in the list of 1146 genes. SP100 is associated with autoimmune disease of the urogenital tract and also with PBC. Interestingly, anti-sp100 autoantibodies have been described for PBC.
