Twin and adoption studies have shown that 40-60% of the inter-individual phenotypic variance is accounted for by genetic factors. In congruence with the observed phenotypic heterogeneity of alcohol dependence, vulnerability to alcohol dependence on the molecular level is thought to be mediated by many genetic loci of small to modest effects in Europeans. Despite strenuous efforts and numerous linkage and candidate gene studies, identification of the underlying susceptibility genes has proven difficult. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) conducted in other complex disorders have been shown to be a successful tool in identifying underlying susceptibility genes (for all published GWAS see: http://www.genome.gov/26525384) and have already resulted in the identification of genetic susceptibility variants for psychiatric disorders such as nicotine addiction, schizophrenia and bipolar disorder which were mostly not detected through other diagnosis based discovery approaches. For alcohol dependence, only one GWAS using pooled DNA samples has been published to date, and it has proposed several new susceptibility loci for alcohol dependence. Their products are implicated in cellular signalling, gene regulation, development and cell adhesion. Convergent translational approaches integrate genetic findings from animal models with a candidate gene or GWAS approach in humans and have proven to be very successful. The goal of the present study was to conduct a GWAS and follow-up study for alcohol dependence using individual genotyping in samples stratified for homogeneity with respect to sex, ethnicity, age at onset, and recruitment procedures.

Near the microsatellite D2S1371, the highest LOD score for comorbid alcoholism and depression phenotype was 4.12 (this LOD score however, was only obtained in one dataset, i.e. in the replication dataset, while in the initial and combined datasets the LOD scores were 0.00 and 2.16, respectively). Marker D2S1371 is located ~1.4Mb away from rs7590720 and rs1344694.

The LR to alcohol is an endophenotype related to heavy drinking and alcohol problems. It is genetically influenced in both animals and humans with an estimated heritability in humans of between 40-50%. Two further linkage studies of the COGA project reported linkage with LOD scores of 3.28 and 3.0, respectively, between the same marker D2S434 and the P3(00) component of the event related potential (ERP). Heritability of the P3 amplitude ranges between 50-80% (for review see ) and P3 deficits have been repeatedly reported to be a strong vulnerability factor for alcohol dependence, especially in males with a high familial loading of alcohol dependence. In a linkage scan conducted by Hill et al. in 330 members from 65 families with a high density of alcohol dependence, linkage to 2q35 with marker D2S2382 was identified.

PECR appears to be a key enzyme of fatty acid metabolism as it catalyzes the reduction of medium chain (unsaturated) enoyl-CoAs to saturated acyl-CoAs which may then undergo oxidation in mitochondria for energy production. This pathway, originating from triglycerides, is particularly important in conditions of starvation when energy supply is switched from utilization of glucose to fatty acids. In this condition, PECR needs to be up-regulated. Triglycerides are typically increased in the blood of alcohol dependent individuals. PECR reduces C-C double bonds in not only even-chain, but also in odd-chain fatty acids. On degradation to acetyl-CoA, odd-chain fatty acids end up with propionyl-CoA, which requires carboxylation to an even-chain fatty acid. This step is mediated through methyl-malonyl-CoA, an intermediate formed by the essential cofactors methyl-tetrahydrofolate as the methyl-donor, and vitamin B12. Folate deficiency, often observed in alcohol-dependent patients, may therefore interfere with this pathway and prevent the availability of a sufficient supply of acetyl-CoA. Expression of PECR is highest in the liver, followed by the kidney, muscle tissue, the lungs and the heart, but barely - if at all - in the brain.If this gene is involved in alcohol dependence, it must act in the periphery rather than in the CNS. It could therefore be expected that we detected PECR only in our GWAS, which identifies susceptibility genes independent of organ-specific expression, but not in the animal approach, which is brain-specific.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 27227, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "A further 4 SNPs are intergenic and further eight SNPs are located in genes. No ontological relatedness was detected between these genes. That is not surprising, given the assumed genetic heterogeneity of alcohol addiction. In the Supplemental Text, we discuss data from linkage findings, biochemistry and animal studies that have provided evidence that these loci may be involved in alcohol dependence. However, none of these markers achieved genome-wide significance in our study. This does not necessarily disqualify them. Alcohol dependence is a complex and heterogeneous disorder that is influenced by multiple genetic, biological, psychological, and sociocultural factors. Formal genetic and linkage studies do not indicate the existence of genes with major effects in the European population. Thus, genome-wide significant findings in moderately-sized samples will be rare, but the number of replicable associations may actually be much larger. One replicated association that did not withstand correction for multiple testing was obtained with the SNP rs1614972 in the ADH1C gene. The ADH gene cluster is located on chromosomal region 4q, which is among the most consistently replicated loci contributing to alcohol phenotypes. The ADH1C gene belongs to the biologically relevant alcohol-metabolising alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) genes. The p-value of this SNP, which was at position 282 of our top-down ranking, achieved a p=2.84x10-4 in the GWAS. It would not have been carried forward into the follow-up study if it had not been supported by evidence from our animal study. In order to achieve a power of 80% to detect significant association withstanding correction for multiple testing, we would have needed to include 5573 patients and 8900 controls (regarding actual OR and MAF of this SNP). The same is true for our replicated association to marker rs11640875 which had rank no. 510 in our GWAS findings. It is located in the cadherin 13 (CDH13) gene, a gene which has been described in previous studies as a susceptibility locus for both alcohol dependence and methamphetamine dependence. Increasing sample sizes is often not feasible and bears the risk of increasing clinical as well as genetic heterogeneity. Experience from GWAS into diabetes, for example, has shown that differences in assessment can jeopardize even the most robust findings. Obtaining very large sample sizes may necessitate inclusion of samples from different cultural and ethnic backgrounds which can also increase heterogeneity. The ADH1C gene belongs to the ADHclass I genes (ADH1A, ADH1B and ADH1C) which have been extensively investigated for the risk of alcohol dependence, initially in Asianand subsequently in Africanand Europeanpopulations. A metaanalysis reported a significantly higher risk of alcohol dependence among carriers of the ADH1C*2 allele (OR=1.91) in East Asian populations, but its role in the European population is less clear. Our associated marker rs1614972 is in complete LD (D'=1.0; r2=0.311, HapMap) with one of the two polymorphisms of the ADH1C*2 protein isoform that has recently been investigated in 575 patients and 530 controls from the Irish Affected Sib Pair Study of Alcohol Dependence (IASPSAD) sample. The two marker haplotype comprised of markers rs1614972 and rs1693482 yielded evidence for association with alcohol dependence. Single marker analysis with rs1614972, however, produced no evidence at all. While the allele frequencies in Irish and German patients are the same, they differ between the Irish and German control samples; the allele frequencies between the German GWAS and the follow-up study being the same.

Prior studies have shown that population stratification in Germansare small. Thus, at the time when SNPs for the follow-up study were chosen, we had not applied a formal test to control for population stratification. A post-hoc principal components analysis (PCA)(EigenSoftv1.01; http://www.genepath.med.harvard.edu/~reich/Software.htm) and genomic control analysis (showing a lambda of 1.099) had no major impact on the significance level of our 15 SNPs (see Supplementary Online Content, eTable 4), thus confirming these prior obervations.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 31859, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Alcohol dependence as defined by DSM-IV is complex, and association studies with more biologically refined (endo) phenotypes will help to disentangle this heterogeneity.
