Polymorphisms within other candidate genes have also been associated with valvular disease in single reports. However, candidate gene studies have been criticized for high false positive rates due to small samples and for the lack of independent replication. In contrast, our study of genomewide association with aortic-valve calcification features a large sample of well-phenotyped persons, uses contemporary criteria for statistical significance, and includes replication in independent cohorts.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 21505, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Lp(a) is a cholesterol-rich particle consisting of a covalently linked molecule of apolipoprotein B100 with a molecule of apolipoprotein(a). Lp(a) has long been considered to be a risk factor for coronary artery disease, and evidence has convincingly shown a causal role for this particle through intimal deposition of Lp(a) and oxidized lipids in the vessel wall and induction of a prothrombotic state. Similar mechanisms could play a role in aortic-valve disease, especially at areas of mechanical injury where Lp(a) may be preferentially retained. Plasma Lp(a) levels are largely genetically determined by variation in the number of kringle IV type 2 (KIV-2) repeats at the LPA locus, which encodes apolipoprotein(a). In a previous study, rs10455872 was shown to be in linkage disequilibrium with the KIV-2 polymorphism and to be strongly associated with both plasma Lp(a) levels and the risk of coronary artery disease.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 22429, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "An association between increased Lp(a) levels and aortic-valve disease has been observed in previous studies. Lp(a) has been shown to accumulate in both early-stage and end-stage aortic-valve lesions and to colocalize with calci- um deposition.

Our results provide evidence for a causal relationship between Lp(a) and calcific aortic-valve disease and strongly implicate genetic variation at the LPA locus in the pathogenesis of the disease.
