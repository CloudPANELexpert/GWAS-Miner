The most common ACE-inhibitor induced ADR is a persistent, dry cough and the most severe one is life threatening angioedema of lips, tongue and upper airway. There is evidence suggesting genetic predisposition to these ADRs; ACE-inhibitor induced cough occurs with higher incidence in East Asian patients (23%) compared with Caucasians (5-11%).

The blood pressure modification takes place through angiotensin I. Accumulation of these inflammatory kinins is hypothesized to be the main reason of ACE-inhibitor induced angioedema and cough. For two decades, multiple candidate genes studies have tested the associations between ACE-inhibitor induced cough and genetic variation in ACE and bradykinin pathways, of which the insertion-deletion (I/D) variation in the ACE gene has been investigated most frequently. A meta-analysis of 12 such studies, did not find a statistically significant association for the ACE I/D polymorphism. Studies on ACE-inhibitor induced angioedema have also been conducted with the same approach; 3 of them found a statistically significant association between ACE-inhibitor induced angioedema and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the XPNPEP2 gene. One study showed that the bradykinin receptor2 (B2) -9/+9 polymorphism is associated with both ACE-inhibitor induced cough and angioedema. However generally, most of the candidate gene approach studies have been difficult to replicate and their results should be interpreted with caution.
