To identify genetic variants associated with each of the five dimensions of personality we performed a genome wide association (GWA) scan of 3,972 individuals from a genetically isolated population within Sardinia, Italy. Based on analyses of 362,129 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) we found several strong signals within or near genes previously implicated in psychiatric disorders. They include the association of Neuroticism with SNAP25 (rs362584, P = 5 x 10-5), Extraversion with BDNF and two cadherin genes (CDH13 and CDH23; Ps < 5 x 10-5), Openness with CNTNAP2 (rs10251794, P = 3 x 10-5), Agreeableness with CLOCK (rs6832769, P = 9 x 10-6), and Conscientiousness with DYRK1A (rs2835731, P = 3 x 10-5). Effect sizes were small (less than 1% of variance), and most failed to replicate in the follow-up independent samples (N up to 3,903), though the association between Agreeableness and CLOCK was supported in two of three replication samples (overall P = 2 x 10-5).

Twin, adoption, and family studies indicate that personality factors are heritable, with about 50% of the variance of the underlying components accounted for by additive and non-additive genetic factors. However, identifying the genetic variants associated with personality traits is challenging. A large number of studies have tested several candidate genes, especially for the Neuroticism factor, but these studies have produced largely inconclusive results. Similarly, genetic linkage studies, usually based on 400-500 microsatellite markers, have suggested loci for Neuroticism, but only a few genomic regions (e.g., 12q) have been reported in multiple studies. Difficulties in identifying specific loci suggest that, as has been observed for a number of quantitative traits, genetic influences on these complex traits are likely attributable to many genes, each with a small effect size. To detect such small genetic effects, there is a growing interest in high throughput genotyping technologies that examine large numbers (e.g., 500,000) of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) densely mapped across the entire genome. Using these more incisive genome-wide association (GWA) scans, recent studies have reliably identified common variants associated with complex traits and diseases that include BMI, height, inflammatory bowel disease, and type 1 and type 2 diabetes. So far, only one GWA study of a personality trait has been published.

Neuroticism (N), the tendency to experience negative emotions such as anxiety, anger, and depression; Extraversion (E), the tendency to be sociable, warm, active, assertive, cheerful, and in search of stimulation; Openness to Experience (O), the tendency to be imaginative, creative, unconventional, emotionally and artistically sensitive; Agreeableness (A), the dimension of interpersonal relations, characterized by altruism, trust, modesty, and cooperativeness; and Conscientiousness (C), a tendency to be organized, strong-willed, persistent, reliable, and a follower of rules and ethical principles. Consistent with their biological basis, these five dimensions can be assessed in all cultures tested so far and the five-factor structure can be clearly replicated in most samples. Sex differences and maturational trends are other universal features of personality, with women everywhere generally scoring higher on Neuroticism and Agreeableness, and with younger people generally scoring higher on Neuroticism, Extraversion, and Openness, but lower on Agreeableness and Conscientiousness in most cultures. Furthermore, the five factors are predictors of important life outcomes, including well-being, academic performance, vocational interests, marital stability and satisfaction, health risk behaviors, and longevity. All five factors are related to personality disorders, and several researchers advocate a dimensional model in the upcoming DSM-V to reorganize the conceptualization and diagnosis of personality disorders. More generally, personality traits are thought of as risk factors, diagnostic indicators, and predictors of onset, severity, and outcome for most psychiatric disorders. These phenotypic links are supported at the genetic level; twin studies indicate that personality traits share a large proportion of genetic variance with depression and other disorders.

Furthermore, abnormalities in the level of SNAP25 have been linked to other psychiatric disorders, and genetic variants in SNAP25 have been associated with cognitive ability. In addition to its intrinsic interest for a personality trait, the association between SNAP-25 and Neuroticism is relevant to several psychiatric disorders for which Neuroticism is an intermediate phenotype/endophenotype.

For Neuroticism, the top SNPs in Sardinia were not among the top signals identified in the previous GWA scan, but we found some evidence for a role of SNAP25, and another SNP, rs1849710, maps in the 12q region where one of the most convincing linkage peaks has been reported.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 24535, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Given the large number of statistical tests performed, the likelihood of false positives is high. To address the problem of multiple testing we evaluated the significance level against the overly-stringent Bonferroni threshold (it is questionable whether the Bonferroni correction is appropriate, and whether the number of tests are truly independent, given that many SNPs are in high LD). Using the Bonferroni threshold, none of the associations between the 5 personality factors and the individual SNPs tested reached the genome-wide significance. Nevertheless, we believe our results provide useful insights into the genetic architecture of personality traits. For example, when we used simulations that took into account the specific structure of the SardiNIA pedigrees, the availability of phenotype data and the pattern individuals genotyped with the 10K and 500K arrays in each family to evaluate the power of experimental design, we estimated ~88% power to detect alleles that account for 1.5% or more of the variance in one of the five main NEO-PI-R personality dimensions (at p < 1x10-5). We expect that we would have nearly 100% power to replicate these associations in samples of >2000 unrelated individuals. Unfortunately, we had only low power (~50% or less) to replicate smaller effects even in our larger follow-up panel of about 2,000 individuals. Since we did not observe any association signals in the SardiNIA sample that replicate consistently in the follow-up samples, it seems unlikely that alleles with large effects on personality exist. Researchers interested in the genetics of personality should not be discouraged because for many other quantitative traits with a definite genetic basis, such as height, it is now clear that most associated common alleles have only modest effects.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 26353, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Caution is also required in rejecting the role of a SNP based on a failed replication attempt. In our case, the use of the relatively homogeneous founder population might have facilitated the detection of associations, but some of the identified SNPs may be particularly difficult to replicate in more heterogeneous populations. For example, the SNPs we identified might be in LD with the functional variant in the Sardinia but not in other populations. Some of the associations we identified might also depend on population-specific genetic or environmental background (gene-gene and gene-environment interactions). The replication samples also differed in recruitment strategies and used shorter and slightly less reliable phenotypic measures, which might have reduced power and contributed to differences across samples. In fact, heterogeneity among candidate gene studies has been linked to differences in the instrument used, but when we scored the SardiNIA data for the shorter questionnaires versions we found little differences in the results. Furthermore, given the universality of the five factors and the commonality of genetic factors for each of a variety of other complex traits that have been studied in many populations, the major limitations are almost certainly the numbers of individuals studied in relation to the small effect sizes observed. Increasing power would likely require much larger initial and follow-up scans. As with other quantitative traits, meta-analysis of genome-wide association scans may provide an effective means to dissect these small effects.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 27940, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "In addition to the five broad dimensions, future research should examine the specific facets (or lower-order traits) that compose each factor. The facets describe more specific and narrow phenotypes, which might be more easily linked to genetic variants. In fact, although facets tend to covary, a high score on the broad factor can result from the effect of different facets across individuals. For example, among those who score high on Neuroticism, some might score high on anxiety but not depression, whereas other might score high on depression but not anxiety. This phenotypic variability increases noise and reduces the likelihood of identifying genetic variants. There is less phenotypic variability associated with the narrower phenotype assessed by facets, which should provide more power for GWA scans. However, analyses of multiple facets increase the number of tests and the risk of false positives.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 28853, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Our results are consistent with most GWA studies of other quantitative traits in identifying SNPs that explain very small amounts of variance, generally less than 1%, and even these estimates for any particular trait/SNP are likely to be inflated (the \"winner's curse\"). However, even a SNP that explains a very small amount of variance can guide our understanding of the biological underpinning of complex phenotypes and diseases. Indeed, genetic association tests across the five personality factors point to several SNPs within genes known for their functions in the brain and their effects on behavior and mental disorders (e.g., SNAP-25, CDH13, CDH23, BDNF, CNTNAP2, CLOCK, CTNNA2, IKBKAP, DYRK1A). These findings seem to reflect the phenotypic links between personality and psychiatric disorders. If confirmed in future studies, these findings might also advance our understanding of the continuum between normal and abnormal personality phenotypes. Given the high degree of comorbidity and other limitations of categorical systems, a dimensional approach to molecular psychiatry might well provide greater power to detect genetic variants associated with psychiatric disorders, and also provide possible points for eventual pharmaceutical intervention.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 30117, "infons": {"section_type": "SUPPL", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "Supplementary Material", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 30140, "infons": {"section_type": "SUPPL", "type": "footnote"}, "text": "Financial disclosure Paul T.
