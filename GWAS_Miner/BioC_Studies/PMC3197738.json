The first model classifies the summarized intensities for each CNV by fitting a finite mixture of Gaussian densities via an EM based algorithm that uses Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) to select the optimal number of classes. Upon convergence, the classification assigns every individual subject to a copy number genotype, and given an optimal model with multiple copy number classes, we tested for its association with the subject's trait with this joint model. This is done by fitting of a generalized logit linear model to test the null hypothesis H0 that there is no association between a subject's copy number genotype and his binary PCa mortality trait (in this case, lethal/indolent).

Unfortunately, due to the long follow-up time and the cost necessary to obtain this information, few studies have information on survival and cause of death or the numbers of lethal cases necessary to study this outcome. A major strength of this study is its ability to examine the primary prostate cancer endpoint, lethal disease, with a substantial number of participants from cohorts that have been followed for decades. The top results were then evaluated in a large case-series that also captures survival data.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 22709, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Figure 3 demonstrates we are only powered to detect relatively strong effects (e.g., OR>2 with MAF>20%). While this is a limitation of our study, it also provides insight into the genetic variants involved in PCa aggressiveness. Based on our data, no common variant will have a large effect on aggressiveness, but rather will most likely have the same magnitude of effect as the alleles that have previously been identified for risk. Although our one SNP that did replicate had a larger combined OR of 2.5, in the replication dataset alone the OR=1.95, suggesting that the initial finding is likely overestimating the magnitude of the effect.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 23352, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Another possible limitation (albeit one that exists in all studies of PCa mortality that are conducted in screened and treated populations) is misclassification of the outcome. Individuals who were labeled as having indolent cancer because they survived at least ten years without developing metastases or dying of cancer may only be in this category because they received aggressive medical treatment, without which they would have died. However, as the results of the Swedish randomized trial of prostatectomy versus watchful waiting suggest, the number needed to treat to save the life of one man with PCa is 19; thus, the potential impact of misclassification is likely to be minimal. Additionally, it is important to investigate if these genetic variants predict PCa mortality independent of clinical variables such as treatment or Gleason score; however, missing data limits our ability to conduct these analyses. We did perform an analysis restricting to the most common Gleason score of 7; while results were somewhat similar to the overall analysis, a larger future study examining these associations among men with Gleason 7 would be interesting and could identify SNPs that are associated with lethal cancer independent of their effects on Gleason. A limitation in the CNV analysis is the number of probes included on this Affymetrix chip; a more comprehensive study of CNVs with PCa mortality should be performed.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 24778, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Although several SNPs have been identified that are associated with risk of prostate cancer, these SNPs in general have not been found to confer an increased risk of aggressive compared to indolent disease. If lethal prostate cancer does indeed have a genetic component, this suggests that genetic variants determining aggressive disease are different from those that confer overall risk.
