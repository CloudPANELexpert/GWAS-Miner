However, as this would only hold for low frequency markers (MAF < ~0.1), we stratified our analysis by score allele frequency (Figure 4a). For simulated models in which all causal variants were of low frequency (<0.05), a stratified analysis revealed the expected, skewed distribution (Figure 4c, Section S17), which was more pronounced for rarer causal alleles, e.g. 1/1,000 (data not shown). In contrast, models in which causal alleles followed a uniform frequency distribution provided a closer fit to our data (Figure 4b; although note some enrichment in the 2nd quintile, of ~13-30% score alleles).
