These discoveries provide support for the polygenic model of breast cancer susceptibility, as well as clues as to important biological pathways involved in the pathogenesis of breast cancer. For example, the most strongly associated risk locus for breast cancer revealed through GWAS has been the region containing the fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2) at chromosome 10q26. FGFR2 is a member of the FGFR family of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) which regulate cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis. The risk variant on chromosome 14q24 is located in intron 12 of RAD51B which is a member of the RAD51 protein family. RAD51 proteins are essential for DNA repair by homologous recombination, a DNA repair pathway with an established and important role in breast cancer development. A more recent study, which included African American subject from the current study, revealed a risk marker at the telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) locus, a protein that controls telomere length and is also implicated in oncogenesis.
