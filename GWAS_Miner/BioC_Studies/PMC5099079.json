To this end, we performed statistical imputation of classical HLA alleles and their corresponding amino acid polymorphisms using a combined reference panel of East Asian and European individuals with previously described methodologies (Online Methods). We observed the strongest association with the classical HLA-DRB1*04:05 allele (OR = 0.14, P = 2.60 x 10-11; Fig. 1), which was unsurprisingly in tight linkage disequilibrium (LD) with rs7765379 (r2 = 0.83). The association at this four-digit allele was more significant than any associations at SNPs or amino acid polymorphisms (Supplementary Table 6). We also performed omnibus tests for association at each amino acid position encoded by eight HLA genes to examine whether multiallelic polymorphism at any amino acid position could explain the association better. None of the omnibus test P values were more significant than the P value for HLA-DRB1*04:05. After we adjusted for the effect of HLA-DRB1*04:05, no other variant remained significant (P > 1 x 10-6), including rs7765379 (adjusted P = 0.62; Supplementary Table 6). In contrast, after we adjusted for the effect of rs7765379, there was still a nominally significant association for the HLA-DRB1*04:05 allele (adjusted P = 0.016), making it more likely that the HLA-DRB1*04:05 allele is a driving factor for this observed HLA association signal. To verify the accuracy of our imputation, we performed HLA typing for 140 individuals from the Vietnam GWAS discovery collection. The allelic concordance between the typed and imputed alleles for HLA-DRB1*04:05 was 99.3%, thus reflecting the robustness of our imputation. Taking the directly typed HLA alleles as the 'gold standard', the sensitivity of the imputation was measured at 100% while the specificity of the imputation was 98.8% (refs.).

The intracellular survival and replication of Salmonella is critical for virulence and essential for systemic disease. Salmonella inject bacterial-derived effector proteins into host cells, such as macrophages, to influence host cell activation and promote bacterial survival. Additionally, Salmonella use dendritic cells for dissemination and restrict the ability of these cells to process antigens and present peptides. Enteric fever is the most severe manifestation of Salmonella infection in humans. It is fatal in 10-25% of patients without antimicrobial treatment, and surviving patients have longer fever clearance times and more severe clinical complications than those that received antimicrobial therapy. This variability in disease severity and outcome is presumably dependent on external and environmental factors, such as exposure and the virulence of the pathogen, and host factors, such as variation in innate and adaptive immune responses during exposure and acute infection. The intimate and streamlined relationship between the human host and the invading Salmonella, in which the bacteria attempt to establish infection in the face of an immune response from the host, represents a fine balance in terms of pathogenicity.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 10178, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "HLA-DRB1 encodes the beta chain of HLA-DR and belongs to the HLA class II molecules, which present antigen to CD4+ T lymphocytes.

Here we show that HLA-DRB1*04:05 is strongly protective against enteric fever. Presence of the HLA-DRB1* 04:05 allele might tip the poise of pathogenicity between the invading pathogen and host immune response toward the human host, resulting in as much as fivefold greater protection from enteric fever. The minor allele of rs7765379 that we observed to confer resistance to enteric fever has previously been shown to strongly associate with increased susceptibility to Crohn's disease and rheumatoid arthritis. This observation is consistent with the possible counterbalancing effects between determinants of infectious disease susceptibility and potential autoimmunity in the host and perhaps more so with genetic determinants exerting as strong an effect as HLA molecules.
