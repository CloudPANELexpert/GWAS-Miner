For example, the HLA-B 1502 allele has been identified as a clinically important predictor of SJS-TEN in Asians of Han Chinese descent who are candidates for treatment with carbamazepine. This finding led the FDA to require a warning label for carbamazepine to indicate the need for genotyping for HLA-B 1502 before the drug is prescribed. This change seems warranted, given the prospective study described in this issue of the Journal, which shows that withholding carbamazepine from subjects of Han Chinese ancestry who carry the HLA-B 1502 allele substantially decreased the rate of the development of SJS-TEN.

Given that the hypersensitivity syndrome occurs in 1 in 5000 to 1 in 10,000 persons, it is unlikely that more than one or two population control subjects would be at risk for hypersensitivity with exposure to carbamazepine. The larger WTCCC collections therefore afforded increased power over that provided by comparison of case subjects with the clinical control subjects. Nevertheless, in analyses involving the 257 clinical control subjects, the association with HLA-A 3101 remained strong for both the hypersensitivity syndrome (odds ratio, 12.41; 95% CI, 1.27 to 121.03) and SJS (odds ratio, 25.93; 95% CI, 4.93 to 116.18), although the effect size was smaller with maculopapular exanthema (odds ratio, 8.33; 95% CI, 3.59 to 19.36).", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 20934, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Additional studies in populations of European descent and other ancestry are required to further characterize this association. The International Serious Adverse Event Consortium is coordinating a global effort to recruit subjects with drug-induced severe adverse events (www.saeconsortium.org). Efforts such as this will facilitate the analysis of larger groups of subjects, which may well uncover other genetic variants associated with a smaller effect size or population-specific variants. Additional work is also required to determine whether the effect of the HLA-A 3101 allele is specific to carbamazepine or whether it also applies to other drugs. A prospective study that is based on the results we present here would facilitate the routine clinical use of HLA-A 3101 testing in carbamazepine treatment. In this issue of the Journal, a report describes how prospective HLA-B 1502 typing can prevent carbamazepine-induced SJS-TEN in Han Chinese populations.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 21907, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "We propose that HLA-A 3101 is clinically relevant as a marker to predict hypersensitivity reactions. On the assumption that the prevalence of carbamazepine-induced hypersensitivity is 5.0%, the presence of the HLA-A 3101 allele increases the risk of hypersensitivity to 26.0%, whereas its absence reduces the risk to 3.8%. Among Japanese patients, the estimated reduction is from 2.9% to 1.1%. The sensitivity and specificity values estimated here for Europeans (26% and 96%) and by others for Japanese populations (61% and 88%) vary. Among a number of possible reasons for these differences are differences in study size, in the frequency of HLA-A 3101 (and potential interacting variation), and in the effect size of the allele across the two populations. Nonetheless, these numbers are similar to those underlying the test criteria calculated for the presence of the HLA-B 5701 allele and abacavir hypersensitivity (sensitivity, 45.5%; specificity, 97.6%; and a risk reduction from 7.8% to 2.7%).", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 22915, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "On the basis of our data, we have calculated that 83 patients would need to be screened to prevent one case of carbamazepine hypersensitivity; the number in the Japanese population is 56. However, it is important to note that this calculation is based on a conservative estimate of the prevalence of carbamazepine hypersensitivity (5%). The prevalence of carbamazepine-induced hypersensitivity that was determined in the context of the Standard and New Antiepileptic Drugs (SANAD) trial (Current Controlled Trials number, ISRCTN38354748) (also involving subjects of European descent) was 10%. On the basis of this prevalence, the number of persons who would need to be screened to prevent one instance of carbamazepine-induced hypersensitivity is 39. We therefore suggest that consideration be given to adding the association with HLA-A 3101 to the drug label for carbamazepine.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset":

Panel B shows P values for single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the HLA-A region. There is a strong association between carbamazepine-induced hypersensitivity syndrome and the HLA-A*3101 allele, with identification of the allele in 40.0% of case subjects and only 4.9% of control subjects. The x axis shows the SNP position on chromosome 6 (National Center for Biotechnology Information build 36). The left y axis shows the negative log10 of P values for the comparison between case subjects and control subjects, as calculated with logistic regression. The right y axis shows the recombination rate on chromosome 6 between 29 and 31 Mb.

Since there were no observations of the HLA-A*3101 allele in the three case subjects with the hypersensitivity syndrome in the EPIGEN cohort, 0.5 was added to each value in a two-by-two contingency table to estimate an odds ratio. One patient with the Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis (SJS-TEN) was of mixed European and Thai ancestry. Study weighting (indicated by different sizes of squares) refers to the proportion of subjects who were recruited from each study cohort. Diamonds indicate pooled odds ratios.
