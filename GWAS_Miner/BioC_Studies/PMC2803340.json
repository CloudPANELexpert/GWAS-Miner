Combining this evidence with the relatively weak LD pattern in the ABCG2 region in the HapMap Yoruban sample and the significant association in ARIC blacks despite the low minor allele frequency of 3%, suggests that the ABCG2 Q141K variant (rs2231142) could be causally related to UA levels.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 21961, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "SLC17A3 encodes a sodium phosphate (Na/Pi) transporter (NPT4), the rat homologue of which localizes to the apical membrane of renal proximal tubule cells.

Hyperuricemia may have influenced the diagnosis of gout in our sample. However, gout was not ascertained at the same time that UA was measured; therefore, this is unlikely to account for the joint association of the SNPs with UA levels and gout. We note that the association between the SNPs and gout was not completely attenuated by adjustment for UA levels, which may be due to the fact that UA levels were measured before the onset of gout in the majority of cases.
