In this study, we included 33 studies from AFGen, of which 31 participated in the GWAS meta-analysis, whereas 17 studies were part of the exome chip analyses. Supplementary Table 21 shows per study overlap of samples between the GWAS and exome chip analyses. The majority of the participants were of European ancestry (15,993 cases, 113,719 referents). We also included studies with African-American (3 studies; 641 cases, 4956 referents), Japanese (1 study; 837 cases, 2456 referents), Hispanic (1 study; 277 cases, 3081 referents), and Brazilian (1 study; 187 cases, 550 referents) ancestry (Supplementary Table 1). The ExWAS and RVAS involved 22,806 cases and 132,612 referents of European (13,496 cases, 96,273 referents), African American (681 cases, 4,871 referents), and Asian (8,180 cases, 28,612 referents) ethnicities (Supplementary Table 2). Overall, adjudication of atrial fibrillation included either documented atrial fibrillation on an electrocardiogram and/or one in-patient or two out-patient diagnoses of atrial fibrillation. Referents were free of atrial fibrillation. All participating studies had obtained informed consent from all cases and referents and had obtained approval from their respective ethics committees or institutional review boards.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 15998, "infons": {"section_type": "METHODS", "type": "title_2"}, "text": "GWAS meta-analyses", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 16017, "infons": {"section_type": "METHODS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Each study performed genotyping and imputation to the 1000 Genomes Project Phase 1 reference panel (March 2012 release).

Models were adjusted for age and sex if available, and if appropriate, for principal components of the genotype matrix to control for population stratification. For studies with prevalent cases at time of enrollment (or blood draw) and incident cases identified during follow up, two analyses were performed: 1) Prevalent analysis at baseline/blood draw: all individuals who were diagnosed with atrial fibrillation prior to baseline were defined as cases, and all individuals who were not diagnosed with AF prior to baseline were defined as referents in a logistic regression analysis (future cases were controls in this analysis); 2) Incident analysis looking forward from baseline: prevalent cases were excluded and time-to-atrial fibrillation diagnosis was analyzed, using Cox proportional hazards models, with censoring at last follow-up. The two analyses are approximately independent, because they consider different periods of risk, as described by Benjamin et al.
