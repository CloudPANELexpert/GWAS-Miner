Non-motor symptoms of PD include dementia, pain, mood disorders, sleep difficulties, and autonomic dysfunction.

Many environmental factors have been implicated in PD, but only a few are consistent across studies (pesticides as a risk factor, smoking and caffeine as protective factors). In addition, an abundance of genetic risk factors have been identified, and many have been replicated and confirmed by subsequent studies. Loci have been identified that act under autosomal dominant (e.g. SNCA, LRRK2) and autosomal recessive (e.g. PRKN, DJ1, PINK1) models, and that function as strong risk factors for development of the disease and other associations with common polymorphisms (e.g. variants in GBA, MAPT). At least 13 loci have been confirmed as PD-related loci and they have been identified through linkage, candidate gene, genome-wide association, and exome sequencing studies. These results are encouraging and exciting; however, there is still a large portion of the genetic component of PD that remains to be uncovered.

SNPs were pruned for linkage disequilibrium (LD) in each region so all pair-wise r2 values were < 0.16 between SNPs. The LD from the HapMap CEPH samples (parents only) was used for pruning. Initially, we chose to use this population for pruning because we were concerned that the consanguinity of the pedigree would cause us to overestimate LD between the SNPs and, subsequently, over-prune the data. Because the HapMap CEPH samples may not be an exact representation of LD in our Amish population, we further tested pruning using the data from this Amish dataset, but no significant difference was seen (data not shown). Because linkage analyses can be affected when breaking larger pedigrees into a series of smaller ones, we performed simulation studies assuming no linkage (e.g. null distribution) and using the same large pedigree structure and the same pedigree splitting method.
