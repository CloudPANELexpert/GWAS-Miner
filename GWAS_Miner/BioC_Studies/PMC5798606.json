Recent studies found that compared to those without anxiety, individuals with GAD had a significantly higher likelihood of suicidal ideation (odds ratios (ORs) = 1.78 - 4.81) and attempted suicides (ORs = 2.70 - 5.59). GAD is most often treated with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs). However, antidepressant treatment response is highly variable in individuals with GAD; while antidepressant treatments are effective for some GAD patients, up to 34% of patients fail to respond favorably. Pharmacogenetic studies investigating the effect of antidepressant drugs on mood disorders have primarily focused on major depressive disorder (MDD), while research on pharmacogenetic treatments for anxiety disorders is limited.
