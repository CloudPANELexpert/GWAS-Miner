Genetic studies using intermediate quantitative traits such as biomarkers, or endophenotypes, benefit from increased statistical power to identify variants that may not pass the stringent multiple test correction in case-control studies. Endophenotypes also contain additional information helpful for identifying variants and genes associated with other aspects of disease, such as rate of progression or onset, and provide context to interpret the results from genome-wide association studies (GWAS). We conducted GWAS of amyloid beta (Abeta42), tau, and phosphorylated tau (ptau181) levels in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from 3146 participants across nine studies to identify novel variants associated with AD. Five genome-wide significant loci (two novel) were associated with ptau181, including loci that have also been associated with AD risk or brain-related phenotypes. Two novel loci associated with Abeta42 near GLIS1 on 1p32.3 (beta = -0.059, P = 2.08 x 10-8) and within SERPINB1 on 6p25 (beta = -0.025, P = 1.72 x 10-8) were also associated with AD risk (GLIS1: OR = 1.105, P = 3.43 x 10-2), disease progression (GLIS1: beta = 0.277, P = 1.92 x 10-2), and age at onset (SER-PINB1: beta = 0.043, P = 4.62 x 10-3). Bioinformatics indicate that the intronic SERPINB1 variant (rs316341) affects expression of SERPINB1 in various tissues, including the hippocampus, suggesting that SERPINB1 influences AD through an Abeta-associated mechanism. Analyses of known AD risk loci suggest CLU and FERMT2 may influence CSF Abeta42 (P = 0.001 and P = 0.009, respectively) and the INPP5D locus may affect ptau181 levels (P = 0.009); larger studies are necessary to verify these results.

Several genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified at least 24 loci containing common variants associated with AD risk. AD is a complex disease that is highly heritable, with an estimated heritability as high as 79% in twin studies and genetic variance analyses estimate >53% of the variance in AD status can be explained by common variants (minor allele frequency, MAF > 1%). Polygenic studies have illustrated the genetic complexity underlying AD; recent studies using polygenic risk scores (PRS) calculated by combining the small effects of independent SNPs associated with AD risk (P < 0.5) provided AD risk prediction accuracy, as measured by area under the receiver operating curve (AUC) > 0.74, which is near the maximum AUC (0.82). These studies indicate many genetic loci combine to increase risk for AD, most of the genetic risk loci are tagged by common variants (MAF > 1%), and that these loci, individually, have small effects on disease. These findings reveal that most AD risk variants have not passed the strict significance threshold required for multiple-test correction in GWAS, even in large studies such as the landmark study by the International Genomics of Alzheimer's Project (IGAP), involving more than 74,000 total individuals, which identified 11 novel loci associated with AD risk. It is also important to note that most AD susceptibility loci identified in these GWAS are gene-dense regions and many significantly associated SNPs are non-coding (intronic or intergenic), making it difficult to determine which genes are involved or how identified variants influence these genes. Studies integrating alternative phenotypes, gene expression, and other omics data are important for understanding the underlying biology of AD.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 4189, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "There is significant evidence that AD pathology is present several years before the onset of clinical symptoms. Consequently, AD case-control GWAS can be confounded by the presence of preclinical \"controls\". Case- control-based GWAS are also limited to identifying genetic associations for disease risk; results from these studies do not provide information about other aspects of disease such as age at onset (AAO) or disease progression, or information about underlying biological mechanisms involved in pathogenesis. Endophenotypes are quantitative traits strongly associated with disease that also share genetic architecture with disease; therefore, genetic studies of endophenotypes are a powerful approach to identify loci associated with complex traits without many of the limitations of case-control studies. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) amyloid-beta1-42 (Abeta42) and phosphorylated tau (ptau181) are well-established AD endophenotypes. CSF ptau181 levels are elevated in AD cases and positively correlate with the number of neurofibrillary tangles, while CSF Abeta42 levels are lower in cases and correlate negatively with plaque load. Increased CSF ptau181 is predictive for cognitive decline and progression from mild cognitive impairment to AD. Some genetic variants associated with AD also influence CSF levels of ptau181, Abeta42, or both. We previously performed GWAS of CSF tau, ptau181, and Abeta42 on 1269 participants (591 cases, 687 controls) and identified four genome-wide significant loci associated with tau and ptau181, including a novel locus that also associated with AD risk, tangle pathology, and cognitive decline.

To maximize the power in our analyses, we performed a one-stage joint-GWAS. The CSF levels were measured with different platforms and at different sites, consequently the raw values could not be combined. Instead, the raw values were log10-transformed to approximate a normal distribution within each separate study and centralized by each study mean. We have used this approach in previous studies and demonstrated that it is an effective way to correct for study differences. We also performed analyses to ensure the results were not confounded by any study bias; to determine if the top hits were being driven by any individual study, we analyzed each dataset separately and performed meta analyses.

This method was successfully used previously to classify AD cases in two independent cohorts with at least 94% sensitivity. Mixture modeling is a statistical method for estimating subpopulations within an overall group; in this case we assumed two normally distributed subgroups within each dataset representing individuals with low Abeta42, therefore likely to be AD cases or preclinical, and with high Abeta42, likely to be cognitively normal controls. Using an expectation-maximization algorithm, we calculated estimated means, standard deviations, and subgroup proportions for each study. Based on the assumption of two univariate normal distributions within each study we obtained two estimated means (micro1 and micro2), two estimated standard deviations (sigma1 and sigma2), and two estimated mixing proportions (lambda1 and lambda2). We used these results to calculate the intersection of the estimated Gaussian curves using the following formula (Eq. 1): analyte, including study, age, sex, and the first two principal components as covariates in the default model. The genomic inflation factor was lambda = 1.02 for ptau181 and lambda = 1.03 for tau and Abeta42 (Supplementary Fig. 7). There were no novel genetic associations identified for CSF tau levels (Supplementary Fig. 8 and Supplementary Table 2) but we did identify novel associations for ptau181 and Abeta42 (Figs. 1, 2; Table 2; Supplementary Tables 3, 4). Conditional analyses were conducted to identify additional independent signals in a locus by adding the SNP with the smallest P value as a covariate into the default regression model and testing all remaining regional SNPs for association (Supplementary Figs. 9, 10). AD status, CDR, APOE alleles, APOE epsilon4 carrier status, Abeta42, or ptau181 levels were corrected for in additional analyses to determine the effects of these phenotypes on the genetic associations (Supplementary Fig. 11 and Supplementary Table 5-Supplementary Table 8). The combined dataset was stratified by AD status and cases and then centered the log10-transformed Abeta42 levels to the intersection of the curves instead of the means for each study (Supplementary Table 1).

Shared heritability between two traits can be estimated using different methods to calculate genetic and phenotypic correlations by linear mixed models, LD scoring, or genome partitioning; but most methods currently available usually require sample sizes in the tens of thousands to counteract statistical noise. Another method to detect shared genetic etiology between traits is to calculate a PRS from a well-characterized cohort, usually from large case-control GWAS, and regress the other trait of interest, such as CSF protein levels, on the PRS in an independent cohort. Small studies (N < 350) have found that PRS were negatively correlated with CSF Abeta42 but not correlated with tau or ptau181. Recent studies of AD cases (N = 338) or individuals with mild cognitive impairment (N = 454), reported that their PRS without APOE were not associated with Abeta42, but tau and ptau were associated with the score without the APOE effect. In our current study of both AD cases and controls (N = 3145), we calculated a PRS composed of genome-wide significant AD risk loci that were reported in the largest AD case-control GWAS thus far. Since the APOE locus is strongly associated with CSF levels and AD risk, it is not unexpected that PRS that include APOE effect would also be significantly associated with Abeta42 and ptau181. Calculating PRS without including the APOE effect can provide information about the much smaller genetic effect of other AD risk loci, and although the individual variants were not even suggestively significant the PRS was significantly associated with both proteins. This suggests there is a genetic overlap between AD risk and the CSF biomarkers that is not apparent in single variant analyses. Since we restricted the PRS to genome-wide significant AD risk loci, we may actually be underestimating genetic overlap between AD risk and CSF Abeta42 and ptau181. Some of the AD risk loci did not appear to be associated with either biomarker, suggesting they affect AD risk through mechanisms independent of Abeta42 and ptau181. Some AD risk loci such as CLU and PERMT2 for Abeta42 and INPP5D for ptau181 may be associated with these AD endophenotypes but did not reach genome-wide significance. Reasons for this could be that multiple risk loci interact to influence CSF levels, or possibly a lack of power due to small effect size of the individual variants.

Loci identified in this study alter gene expression or protein binding, which can provide valuable information for understanding the biological basis for AD pathology. We identified here, for the first time, two genome-wide significant signals for CSF Abeta42 outside the APOE region. Of particular interest is the locus on 6p25 which is associated with lower CSF Abeta42 and earlier AAO. This may be mediated through SERPINB1, because the same SNPs affect SERPINB1 expression in blood and macrophages. SERPINB1 encodes a serine protease inhibitor that is a key regulator of neutrophil programmed cell death. SERPINB1 is expressed in the human brain, primarily in microglia and macrophages. Recent research of transgenic mouse models for AD (5xFAD and 3xTg-AD) reported that neutrophils were present in the brain near Abeta deposits, and researchers observed neutrophil migration from blood into the brain toward amyloid plaques. They discovered that Abeta42 triggered the high-affinity state of integrin LFA-1, which is necessary for neutrophil infiltration of the CNS. Their results, combined with our findings that genetic variants that increase expression of SERPINB1 are also associated with lower levels of Abeta42, support other studies suggesting that immune response pathways may play a key role in AD pathology. Our results indicate a potential role for SER-PINB1 in AD and suggest that adaptive immune response mechanisms are associated with Abeta-mediated pathology. Key proteins in neuroinflammation, triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) and YKL-40, are promising AD biomarkers, and TREM2 variants are also strongly associated with AD risk. Clusterin (CLU) has been associated with AD risk in numerous studies and a GWAS of CSF CLU levels suggested CLU may be associated with immune response. Our findings add to this growing evidence that immune response plays a key role in AD and CSF levels of Abeta42 may be representative of this role.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 47285, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The associations of the GMNC locus with ptau181 levels and brain volume suggest biological mechanisms other than immune response may be associated with tau-mediated pathology in AD. Although not well studied, GMNC (also known as GEMC1) is a necessary regulator of DNA replication and recently was shown to be a key player in the differentiation of radial glial cells to multiciliated neuroepithelial cells during neurogenesis in the sub-ventricular zone. Combined with our GWAS results, it appears GMNC may influence CSF ptau181 as part of the neurogenesis process. Further research is needed to determine if GMNC is indeed the gene affecting ptau181 and what biological mechanism is involved. However, some of the loci associated with ptau181 suggest immune response may also play a role in tau-associated pathology. NFATC1 encodes the nuclear factor of activated T-cells cytoplasmic 1 protein which is important in gene transcription induced by immune response. CTDP1 encodes the RNA polymerase II subunit A C-terminal domain phosphatase which interacts with the TFIIF transcription factor. Both NFATC1 and CTDP1 are expressed in the human temporal cortex, NFATC1 (58th percentile) more so than CTDP1 (37th percentile). NFATC1 is also the more promising candidate than CTDP1 because CTDP1 is primarily expressed in fetal astrocytes and nominally in other cell types, while NFATC1 is predominantly expressed in microglia and macrophages (Supplementary Table 13). We were unable to test for the putative causal variant in these regions for these eQTL effects. However, these data suggest the top loci may influence ptau181 levels by affecting expression of these genes.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 48955, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "In summary, by increasing the sample size more than twofold we not only verified the results from our previous analyses, but also uncovered additional findings that can be used to inform future AD studies. We identified novel associations between genetic loci and CSF levels that may provide insight into the biological mechanisms that affect protein levels, influence AD risk, AAO, and disease progression. Our findings suggest CSF Abeta42 levels may be representative of the role of immune response on Abeta-associated pathology, and that this role may influence AAO. Although immune-related genes may be associated with ptau181, our results suggest that CSF ptau181 may reflect pathways related to neurogenesis and brain volume. Although we did not identify individual AD risk variants outside the APOE region, the PRS results indicate shared genetic architecture between AD risk and these CSF biomarkers. Larger studies using AD endophenotypes will likely provide even more information to help understand the biology underlying AD pathology.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 50001, "infons": {"section_type": "SUPPL", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "Supplementary Material", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 50024, "infons": {"section_type": "SUPPL", "type": "footnote"}, "text": "Data used in preparation of this article were obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database (adni.loni.usc.edu).
