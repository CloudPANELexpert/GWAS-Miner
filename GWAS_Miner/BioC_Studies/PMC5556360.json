Both of these features are indicative of an important genetic component in ALS etiology. Following initial discovery of a risk-associated C9orf72 locus in ALS genome-wide association studies (GWAS), identification of a pathogenic hexanucleotide-repeat expansion in this locus revolutionized the field of ALS genetics and biology.

Even though LMM analysis for ascertained case-control data potentially results in a small loss of power in comparison to meta-analysis, we judged the advantage of combining all strata while controlling the false positive rate to be more important than this potential loss and therefore jointly analyzed all strata in an LMM to identify additional risk loci. There was no overall inflation of the LMM test statistics in comparison to the meta-analysis test statistics (Supplementary Fig. 2). We observed modest inflation of test statistics in the quantile-quantile plot (lambdaGC = 1.12, lambda1,000 = 1.01; Supplementary Fig. 3). LD score regression yielded an intercept of 1.10 (standard error of 7.8 x 10-3). Although an LD score regression intercept higher than 1.0 can indicate the presence of residual population stratification, which is fully corrected for in an LMM, this can also reflect a distinct genetic architecture where most causal variants are rare or a noninfinitesimal architecture. The LMM identified all four genome-wide-significant associations from the meta-analysis.

Understanding where these unidentified risk variants remain across the allele frequency spectrum will inform the design of future studies to identify these variants.

C21orf2 has also been localized to mitochondria in immune cells and is part of the interactome of the protein product of NEK1, which has previously been associated with ALS. Both proteins seem to be involved in DNA repair mechanisms. Although future studies are needed to dissect the function of C21orf2 in ALS pathophysiology, we speculate that defects in C21orf2 may lead to primary cilium and/or mitochondrial dysfunction or inefficient DNA repair and thereby result in adult-onset disease. The other associated loci will require more extensive studies to fine-map causal variants. SARM1 has been suggested to be a susceptibility gene for ALS, mainly because of its role in Wallerian degeneration and its interaction with UNC13A.
