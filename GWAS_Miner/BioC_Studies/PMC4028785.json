To identify genes influencing variation in plasma adiponectin levels, we performed genome-wide linkage and association scans of adiponectin in two cohorts of subjects recruited in the Genetic Epidemiology of Metabolic Syndrome Study. The genome-wide linkage scan was conducted in families of Turkish and southern European (TSE, n = 789) and Northern and Western European (NWE, N = 2,280) origin. A whole genome association (WGA) analysis (500K Affymetrix platform) was carried out in a set of unrelated NWE subjects consisting of approximately 1,000 subjects with dyslipidemia and 1,000 overweight subjects with normal lipids. Peak evidence for linkage occurred at chromosome 8p23 in NWE subjects (lod = 3.10) and at chromosome 3q28 near ADIPOQ, the adiponectin structural gene, in TSE subjects (lod = 1.70). In the WGA analysis, the single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) most strongly associated with adiponectin were rs3774261 and rs6773957 (P < 10-7). These two SNPs were in high linkage disequilibrium (r2 = 0.98) and located within ADIPOQ. Interestingly, our fourth strongest region of association (P < 2 x 10-5) was to an SNP within CDH13, whose protein product is a newly identified receptor for high-molecular-weight species of adiponectin. Through WGA analysis, we confirmed previous studies showing SNPs within ADIPOQ to be strongly associated with variation in adiponectin levels and further observed these to have the strongest effects on adiponectin levels throughout the genome.

It is sobering that the most strongly associated SNPs in our analysis accounted for <2% of the variance in adiponectin levels in this population. Possibly, the associated SNPs are in linkage disequilibrium with a true functional SNP in the region and this functional variant has a larger effect. More broadly, however, it seems likely that simple sequence variants at a single locus capture only a small part of the total genetic contribution to trait variation:other genetic effects may stem from interaction among single loci and between individual loci and environmental factors, or from epigenetic factors that influence gene expression. Additionally, it is possible that much of the genetic effect on adiponectin is attributable to multiple rare variants, each associated with a relatively large effect. GWAS studies are not well suited for detecting rare variants and sequencing of candidate regions (e.g., ADIPOQ) may be required. We did, however, observe strong evidence for linkage in the NWE families to chromosome 8p23 (BMI-adjusted lod = 3.10; D8S264/ D8S1825). To our knowledge, no previous studies have detected significant linkage (lod >3) to adiponectin levels on chromosome 8p23; however, linkages to BMI have been reported within or around this region, including in Nigerians, in European whites from the Framingham Heart Study, and in a meta-analysis of five independent genome-wide scans. An attractive candidate gene in this region is lipoprotein lipase (LPL, 8p22, 39.3 cM, physical map position: 19.9 Mb), which encoded an enzyme that plays a critical role in transporting fats and breaking down fat-carrying particles and preheparin LPL mass. Although LPL mass has been found to be significantly correlated with insulin sensitivity and adiponectin levels, we did not observe any association between SNPs in LPL and adiponectin in this population.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 25638, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Our observation of higher plasma adiponectin levels observed in subjects from NWE families compared to subjects from TSE families is intriguing and cannot be explained simply by differences in BMI between the two populations. Differences in adiponectin levels across ethnic groups have previously been reported:e.g., Japanese > Chinese and Hispanic Americans > African Americans. It is possible that these differences stem from differences in other metabolic measures between populations or that they result from differences in other lifestyle factors. Higher adiponectin levels observed in women compared to men are also widely observed, and this sex dimorphism might be partially explained by the selective inhibition effect from testosterone in both human and mice. In the population-based study, although BMI is higher in cases than in controls, the difference of adiponectin levels between cases and controls could not be explained by age, sex, and BMI (P < 0.001). This is consistent with a prior study showing that adiponectin concentrations are correlated with serum lipids independently of BMI and that following weight loss, changes in adiponectin are significantly correlated with changes in HDL-C and triglyceride, independently of changes in BMI and insulin sensitivity.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 26924, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "In conclusion, our results support an effect of DNA variation at the ADIPOQ locus influencing plasma adiponectin levels. However, the degree to which DNA sequence variants at this locus influence health and disease remains to be seen. Furthermore, our analyses indicated that SNPs at the ADIPOQ locus were the most strongly associated with adiponectin variation throughout the entire genome.
