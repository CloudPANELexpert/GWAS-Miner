The natural course of chronic HCV infection is characterized by high levels of inter-individual variation in disease progression. Most subjects never develop cirrhosis, but some may develop severe fibrosis in less than 20 years. A number of host demographic and clinical characteristics, as well as viral factors, have been associated with the development of HCV-related liver fibrosis. However, these factors account for only a small proportion of the variability in the rate of liver fibrosis development, which overall remains unpredictable. There is accumulating evidence to suggest that host genetic factors are involved, although these factors remain largely unknown. A number of candidate gene approaches have been used in attempts to identify variants influencing the development of liver disease in HCV-infected patients, but most of these studies produced results that were not consistently replicated. Two related studies investigating ~25,000 putative functional SNPs identified a panel of SNPs predicting the risk of developing cirrhosis; this panel requires validation in prospective studies. A recent study of 36 candidate genes, related to the fibrogenesis/fibrolysis process, identified a single cluster of variants of the IFNGR2 gene associated with progression to severe fibrosis.

A recent candidate gene study found that IL28B alleles associated with poor HCV clearance had a protective effect against liver inflammation and fibrosis. No GWA study has yet explored genetic susceptibility to liver fibrosis in patients with chronic HCV infection. Several GWA studies of liver disease-related traits demonstrated a role for a non-synonymous variant of the PNPLA3 gene, rs738409 (I148M), in the development of nonalcoholic and alcoholic fatty liver disease and associated disease severity. The same PNPLA3 risk allele was recently associated with steatosis and liver fibrosis in patients with chronic HCV infection.

Fibrosis was assessed by experienced pathologists working in the local expert liver centers corresponding to the place of collection, and all biopsies were considered as interpretable by each local pathologist. Metavir scoring system is validated since many years and highly reproducible for pathologists specialized in liver disease. For each patient, we used the information obtained from a single biopsy, referred to as the reference biopsy. For patients who had undergone several biopsies, the reference biopsy was defined as follows: (i) the most recent biopsy obtained in the absence of treatment for patients who had not spontaneously developed fibrosis, i.e. all biopsy results without treatment were F0 or F1; (ii) the biopsy with the highest Metavir score for patients who had developed fibrosis, i.e. at least one biopsy result >=F2; the earliest biopsy was selected if there were several biopsies with the highest score. We used three different approaches to define liver fibrosis phenotype on the basis of the Metavir score for the reference biopsy. The first of these approaches was a classic case/control approach in which F0-1 patients were considered as controls and F3-4 patients, as cases. Patients with an intermediate Metavir score (F2) were discarded for this analysis, which was thus a binary F0-1/F3-4 phenotype analysis. Within this approach, we also used a more extreme definition of the phenotypes, in which we considered only F0 patients as controls and F4 patients as cases (binary F0/F4 phenotype analysis). In the second approach, we used survival analysis techniques to take into account the individual duration of infection in the analysis. Failure (F3-4 or only F4) and censored (F0-1 or only F0) events were defined as in the case/control study, and the duration of infection was estimated from the presumed year of HCV acquisition to the year in which the biopsy was carried out. The estimated date of HCV acquisition was obtained using the first reported major event at risk among blood transfusion, drug use (the first year of injecting drug use (IDU) was used as the starting point), accidental needle stick or other invasive medical procedures. In this analysis, the phenotype is denoted duration F0-1/F3-4 or duration F0/F4. In the third approach, liver fibrosis progression was considered as a quantitative phenotype, fibrosis progression rate (FPR), corresponding to the ratio of Metavir score to the estimated duration of infection in years (Metavir units per year). Patients with a F2 Metavir score were included in this analysis. Given the distribution of FPR, this phenotype was log-transformed and then inverse normal quantile-transformed in each cohort before statistical analysis. The resulting phenotype, denoted as QTF phenotype, was further standardized such that the differences in mean QTF rates between genotypes for a given SNP could be expressed in standard deviation units, referred to as standardized Metavir units (SMUs). Posterior to the selection of the 96 followed-up SNPs (see next sections), we analyzed our primary data by modeling transition probabilities between Metavir stages using a Markov model, described in Supplementary Methods.

Although Mendelian defects of these two genes affect only the retina, both genes have a broader spectrum of expression, with TULP1 expressed in the fetal liver and MERTK expressed in macrophages. In addition, the MERTK and TULP1 proteins have been shown to interact during the phagocytosis of apoptotic cells. In particular, mice lacking specifically the murine homolog of MERTK display a deficiency in the clearance of apoptotic thymocytes by macrophages. Interestingly, the clearance of apoptotic debris by phagocytosis can directly stimulate fibrogenesis. Hepatic stellate cells (HSC) may play a key role in this process, as they have phagocytic functions, including the NADPH oxidase activity required for the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). HSC are also found in close proximity to hepatocytes, a key source of apoptotic debris during liver injury. Overall, our results suggest a possible relationship between the clearance of apoptotic cells through phagocytosis and liver fibrosis.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 24967, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The second signal significant at the genome-wide level was that for SNP rs16851720 in the whole sample. The effect of this SNP on fibrosis progression rate (FPR) was clearly additive in our combined cohort (Figure 2A). If FPR means were calculated directly as a function of rs16851720 genotypes, we found that each A risk allele increased the rate of liver fibrosis progression by 0.033 Metavir units/year, corresponding to ~1 Metavir unit over a 30-year period. This SNP is located in the first intron of RNF7, which is also known as SAG (sensitive to apoptosis gene). RNF7 is a cell-protecting molecule that acts as an antioxidant, inhibiting the apoptosis induced by metal ions and ROS, thereby preventing DNA damage. In this context, it is interesting to note that HCV inhibits host DNA damage repair through ROS production. The induction of these processes, including high levels of ROS production in particular, in HCV-infected cells leads to hepatocyte apoptosis and HSC activation, and may also contribute to the development of liver fibrosis through mechanisms described above.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 26054, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "In conclusion, for the whole sample, we found a genome-wide significant effect of the SNP rs16851720 on liver fibrosis, and confirmed the role of the PNPLA3 non-synonymous I148M variant. We also found some interesting additional signals, including one genome-wide significant, in more refined subsamples, which require further investigation. Overall, our findings suggest that several variants in a number of genes with rather modest effects (in the whole sample) and/or more complex effects (e.g. limited to a specific subsample) may be involved in genetic susceptibility to liver fibrosis secondary to chronic HCV infection. They also point out the role of apoptosis potentially providing new insights into the mechanisms underlying liver fibrosis development.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 26817, "infons": {"section_type": "SUPPL", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "Supplementary Material", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 26840, "infons": {"section_type": "SUPPL", "type": "footnote"}, "text": "Conflicts of interest: The authors disclose no conflicts.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 26898, "infons": {"section_type": "SUPPL", "type": "footnote"}, "text": "Contributions: L.
