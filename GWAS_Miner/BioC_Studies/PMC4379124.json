One could argue that this is because sub-phenotyping loses power by reducing the size of the sample and that recruiting larger samples with homogeneous phenotype would lead to the identification of some associated SNPs. However, test statistics closely follow the expected linear relationship with square root of sample size. (Fig. 1A), suggesting that sub-phenotypes are not highly informative for genetic discovery. (Indeed, if sub-phenotypes were highly informative for genetic discovery we would expect some noteworthy deviation from the linear fit observed in Figure 1). Alleles scores, based on a small subset of SNPs, predict case status in the full sample and in subsamples based on various phenotypes (e.g., meeting ASD diagnostic criteria and manifesting repetitive behaviors) equally well. The similarity of the proportion of variance explained among subgroups suggests that subgrouping does not contribute much to our understanding of the genetics of risk for ASD in its various clinical forms. Taken together with the similarity of heritability estimates across subsamples this strongly suggests that subgrouping based on clinical phenotypes does little to modify the genetic architecture of autism risk in each subgroup and does not substantially increase genetic homogeneity. Consistent with these results, sub-phenotyping does not significantly shift one sided z scores toward higher values for any SNP. Remarkably, heritability estimates in the higher IQ group and the full sample show very little difference, even ignoring sampling error suggesting that the architecture of autism risk is similar in high IQ and low IQ populations. Intriguingly, this result appears at odds with the observation of a significant enrichment for de novo loss of function mutations in individuals with low IQ. We can not exclude that the relatively small size of the sample of people with low IQ, due to the large fraction of individuals with high IQ in the SSC, could obscur the difference in heritability. However, the results are also consistent with common variants making similar contribution to the ASD phenotype for both groups, while de novo mutations, in general, have a modest impact on risk for ASD and a greater impact on IQ.

On the other hand, taking the results presented here together with the emerging picture of autism risk architecture regarding for common variants, they suggest that phenotype is the result of the complex combination of a large number of modest allelic effects on each trait. If, as some authors have proposed, we can assume that there is no common variant of substantial effect on the risk of ASD (odds ratio> 1.2), but a great number of common variations with a more modest impact, the identification of common risk variants is hindered mainly by sample size and only marginally by clinical heterogeneity even in samples carefully phenotyped to confirm an ASD diagnosis. Thus the results of this study advocate for recruitment of larger cohorts of ASD subjects to identify common variation affecting risk for ASD. Indeed, while GWAS studies in ASD are large relative to earlier candidate gene studies, their sample sizes are still small relative to the majority of the studies in other complex diseases.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 25933, "infons": {"section_type": "SUPPL", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "Supplementary Material", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 25956, "infons": {"section_type": "SUPPL", "type": "footnote"}, "text": "Supplemental information: Yes, with 2 tables and 1 figure", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 26014, "infons": {"section_type": "SUPPL", "type": "footnote"}, "text": "Financial Disclosures: Dr. Cathy Lord receives royalties for the scales of diagnostic instruments for which she's a coauthor; she donates all royalties to autism charities.
