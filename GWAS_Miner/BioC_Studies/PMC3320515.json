To identify genetic risk factors for neuroblastoma, we performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) on 2,251 patients and 6,097 control subjects of European ancestry from four case series. Here we report a significant association within LIM domain only 1 (LMO1) at 11p15.4 (rs110419, combined P = 5.2 x 10-16, odds ratio of risk allele = 1.34 (95% confidence interval 1.25-1.44)). The signal was enriched in the subset of patients with the most aggressive form of the disease. LMO1 encodes a cysteine-rich transcriptional regulator, and its paralogues (LMO2, LMO3 and LMO4) have each been previously implicated in cancer. In parallel, we analysed genome-wide DNA copy number alterations in 701 primary tumours. We found that the LMO1 locus was aberrant in 12.4% through a duplication event, and that this event was associated with more advanced disease (P < 0.0001) and survival (P = 0.041). The germline single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) risk alleles and somatic copy number gains were associated with increased LMO1 expression in neuroblastoma cell lines and primary tumours, consistent with a gain-of-function role in tumorigenesis. Short hairpin RNA (shRNA)-mediated depletion of LMO1 inhibited growth of neuroblastoma cells with high LMO1 expression, whereas forced expression of LMO1 in neuroblastoma cells with low LMO1 expression enhanced proliferation. These data show that common polymorphisms at the LMO1 locus are strongly associated with susceptibility to developing neuroblastoma, but also may influence the likelihood of further somatic alterations at this locus, leading to malignant progression.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 1831, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Multiple somatically acquired chromosomal rearrangements, such as focal amplification of the MYCN oncogene or deletions at chromosome arms 1p or 11q, are each associated with an aggressive neuroblastoma phenotype.

Highly penetrant gain-of-function mutations in the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) tyrosine kinase domain were recently identified as the major cause of familial neuroblastoma, and somatic mutations in this gene implicate it as a target for therapeutic intervention. In addition, a neuroblastoma GWAS identified common SNPs at 6p22 as being associated with susceptibility to aggressive neuroblastoma in sporadic cases; follow-up association analysis on the clinically relevant group of patients with an aggressive tumour phenotype indicated that common SNPs within BARD1 also function as susceptibility variants. Finally, our GWAS has also identified a common copy number variation at 1q21.1 being highly associated with neuroblastoma and probably playing a role in early tumorigenesis through disruption of a novel neuroblastoma breakpoint family gene (NBPF23).

Combined analysis by the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel method demonstrated that two of the four SNPs had P values that extend well beyond the genome-wide significance threshold (Table 1). Additionally, using the two cohorts with whole-genome genotype data (discovery cohort and US replication cohort), we performed genotype imputation at 11p15.4 and identified six additional genome-wide significant markers, the most significant being rs110420 (P = 1.17 x 10-13), which is in complete linkage disequilibrium (r2 = 1 in HapMap CEU subjects (Utah residents with ancestry from northern and western Europe) with the genotyped marker rs110419 (Fig. 1c and Supplementary Table 5).", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 6267, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "We next determined if the LMO1 genotypes were associated with a particular clinical phenotype and/or patient survival.

Most provocatively, retroviral insertion of the corrective gene for X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency into the LMO2 locus resulted in T-cell leukaemias in several participants in gene therapy trials. LMO4 represses the transcription of BRCA1, and dys-regulation of LMO4 expression has been implicated in the breast car-cinogenesis. Finally, LMO3 has been shown to act as an oncogene in neuroblastoma through the neuronal transcription factor HEN2.

Cell lines with diploid 11p status and harbouring homozygous risk alleles showed significantly higher LMO1 mRNA and protein expression than those with homozygous non-risk alleles (Fig. 2a and Supplementary Table 11). This trend held in an expanded set of 25 neuroblastoma cell lines with variable 11p status (Supplementary Fig. 8). To determine if this correlation existed in diagnostic tumour tissues, we next examined mRNA expression levels on a whole-genome Affymetrix expression microarray in a subset of 61 neuroblastoma primary tumours from patients whose blood samples and primary tumours had both been genotyped on the Illumina SNP arrays. Among these 61 tumours, 13 harboured somatic gain of 11p. Considering both somatic and germline genotypes in the same linear regression model, we detected an association between LMO1 copy number gains and increased LMO1 expression (P = 0.02; Fig. 2b and Supplementary Table 12), as well as an association between rs110419 risk alleles and increased LMO1 expression (P = 0.022; Fig. 2b). To refine the genotype-expression relationships further, we subsequently used quantitative PCR to measure LMO1 expression in an additional set of 23 tumours without LMO1 gain. We confirmed that the rs110419 risk allele is associated with LMO1 expression (P = 0.01), independent of copy number changes (Fig. 2c). To determine whether a regulatory variant exists at a narrow promoter region of LMO1, we performed Sanger sequencing in 20 neuroblastoma cell lines but did not detect any potential causal variant (Supplementary Table 13). Examination of the 1000 Genomes Project data identified over 300 SNPs within or surrounding LMO1 that are in moderate to strong linkage disequilibrium (D' > 0.5) with rs110419 (Supplementary Table 14); however, fine mapping of this region through resequencing will be required to identify whether any are causal cis-regulatory variants.

Cells with the homozygous neuroblastoma-associated genotype and high LMO1 expression showed significantly decreased proliferation compared with mock-infected controls (Fig. 3a, b), whereas cells with homozygous non-risk alleles showed little phenotypic effect (Fig. 3c, d). Finally, to determine the cellular phenotypes of forced overexpression of LMO1, we stably overexpressed LMO1 with approximately fourfold higher levels in the SK-N-BE2C cell line with low de novo LMO1 expression, and detected significantly enhanced proliferation (Fig. 3f).
