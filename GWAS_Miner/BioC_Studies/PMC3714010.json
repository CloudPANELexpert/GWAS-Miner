The major syndromes:especially schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and major depression:were differentiated on the basis of their symptom patterns and course of illness. At the same time, clinical features such as psychosis, mood dysregulation, and cognitive impairments were known to transcend diagnostic categories.

Second, diagnostic misclassification (eg, reciprocal misdiagnosis of cases of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder) could produce spurious evidence of genetic overlap between disorders. However, a substantial degree of misdiagnosis would be needed to account for our findings of loci that affect all or subsets of five disorders whose diagnostic criteria are fairly distinct. Third, the five disorders we examined were limited to those for which large-scale GWAS datasets have been assembled by the PGC and processed through a uniform quality-control process. As further datasets become available, more comprehensive analyses of cross-disorder genetic effects on psychiatric illness should be pursued. Fourth, we restricted our analyses to individuals of European ancestry. Whether our findings apply to other populations is unknown. Finally, GWAS designs are suited to identify common variant aspects of genetic architecture; further studies (including analyses of copy-number variants and rare mutations) will be needed to account more completely for shared genetic contributions across disorders. As in almost all GWAS of complex disorders reported so far, the effect sizes of genome-wide significant loci are individually quite small and the variance they account for is insufficient for predictive or diagnostic usefulness by themselves.

defined as descriptive syndromes on the basis of a consensus of experts. The aetiological relations among these disorders are a topic of active debate in view of the imminent revision of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) and the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11). Many family and twin studies have documented familial and heritable overlap between subsets of the five disorders we examined. Genetic association studies including samples smaller than those reported here have provided some support for these associations at a molecular level. We searched the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) GWAS catalogue as of September, 2012, to identify all previous reports of genome-wide significant association for any of the five disorders. For each significant gene or gene region identified, we then searched Medline for reports of at least nominally significant association (p<0 001) with at least one of the remaining four disorders. Several such loci have been reported including CACNA1C (for schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and major depressive disorder), ZNF804A, ANK3, DGKH, and the 3p21.1 and NCAN (schizophrenia and bipolar disorder). Furthermore, polygene score analyses have shown significant overlap between schizophrenia and bipolar disorder and between bipolar disorder and major depressive disorder. Finally, several rare copy-number variations associated with autism spectrum disorders have been detected in schizophrenia, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, bipolar disorder, and recurrent major depressive disorder. However, no previous studies have examined cross-disorder effects encompassing all five of the disorders examined here.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 34890, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "Interpretation", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 34905, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "This analysis provides the first genome-wide evidence that individual and aggregate molecular genetic risk factors are shared between five childhood-onset or adult-onset psychiatric disorders that are treated as distinct categories in clinical practice. As such, our findings are relevant to the goal of moving beyond descriptive syndromes in psychiatry and towards a nosology informed by disease cause. The finding that genetic variants have cross-disorder effects is an empirical step towards helping clinicians understand the common co-occurrence of clinical phenotypes in individual patients. Our results implicate a specific biological pathway:voltage-gated calcium-channel signalling:as a contributor to the pathogenesis of several psychiatric disorders, and support the potential of this pathway as a therapeutic target for psychiatric disease.
