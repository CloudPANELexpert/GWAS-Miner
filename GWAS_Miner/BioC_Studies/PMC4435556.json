Neurodevelopmental in origin, ASP is characterized by deficits in social interaction and the presence of repetitive behaviors or circumscribed interests. Unlike in autism, the prototypical ASD, language acquisition and cognition are typically spared. Despite formal recognition as a diagnostic category, there has been continued debate as to whether ASP represents a separate diagnostic entity or is simply a milder version of autism [;]. Differentiation of ASP from other ASD relies on behavioral methods as consistent biological markers unique to ASP (e.g., serum markers or neuroimaging) have not been found. Clearly, individuals with ASP show relatively superior language and cognitive traits. However, it is unclear if these traits reflect underlying biological differences. There are few reports that have tied biological variation to specific symptoms or behavioral traits in ASP. Neuroimaging of metabolic activity in regions implicated in ASD was able to distinguish ASD cases with and without language impairment.

However, gene mapping has been hindered by significant clinical and genetic heterogeneity. One solution has been to identify clinically homogeneous subgroups for genetic mapping. Several investigators have looked to ASD subphenotypes with promising results. For instance, found significant linkage on chromosome 15q13.3-q14 in a subgroup of individuals with ASD with IQ>=70 (LOD = 4.01) and on chromosome 11p15.4-p15.3 in a subgroup with delayed onset of phrase speech (LOD = 3.4). In contrast, none of the LOD scores were >3 in their overall ASD data set. showed linkage on chromosome 1q24.2 in a subgroup of autism-affected relative pairs with more severe obsessive-compulsive behavior. Another strategy has been to examine clinical subphenotypes such as ASP. The genetic risk for the ASP subphenotype may be due to fewer or a different set of genetic loci compared to the broader ASD diagnostic group. A genome-wide linkage study of ASP in 13 Finnish families found Zmax >1.5 on nine chromosomal regions, 1q21-22, 3p14-24, 3q25-27, 4p14, 4q32, 6p25, 6q16, 13q31-33 and 18p11.
