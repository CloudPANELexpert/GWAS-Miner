However, our study may have had modest power to detect novel loci and significant overlap with genetic variation of other addictions, given the sample size, measurement error in food addiction assessment and the narrow range and low prevalence of food addiction symptomology. The latter might be addressed in future studies by employing a case-enrichment design. The ability to identify shared genetic determinants of food and drug addiction may also be limited by incomplete knowledge of genetic determinants of drug addiction.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 23729, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "footnote"}, "text": "Disclosure: The authors declare no conflict of interest.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 23786, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "footnote"}, "text": "Author Contributions: MCC designed the study, performed the analysis and wrote the manuscript.
