We conducted a genome-wide association study to identify genetic mechanisms that distinguish non-demented elderly with a heavy NFT burden from those with a low NFT burden. The study included 344 non-demented subjects with autopsy (201 subjects with low and 143 with high NFT levels). Both a genotype test, using logistic regression, and an allele test provided genome-wide significant evidence that variants in the RELNgene are associated with neuropathology in the context of cognitive health. Immunohistochemical data for reelin expression in AD-related brain regions added support for these findings. Reelin signaling pathways modulate phosphorylation of tau, the major component of NFTs, either directly or through beta-amyloid pathways that influence tau phosphorylation. Our findings suggest that up-regulation of reelin may be a compensatory response to tau-related or beta-amyloid stress associated with AD even prior to the onset of dementia.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 1262, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "1.

Tau is a microtubule-associated protein abundant in neurons and the primary component of NFTs. Normal reelin levels are necessary to prevent abnormal phosphorylation of tau. Reelin is also associated with plaques in beta-amyloid precursor protein/presenilin-1 double-transgenic mouse brains. A recent report indicates a role for reelin in protecting against beta-amyloid-induced suppression of long-term potentiation and NMDA receptors. Thus, reelin may play key roles in AD pathology both extracellularly with its involvement in plaques and intracellularly via inhibition of tau phosphorylation. Since tau phosphorylation is a key step in the formation of NFTs, our finding of an association between RELN polymorphisms and high levels of AD neuropathology is compelling. We note that the two RELN SNPs found to be associated with high levels of AD pathology in this study are probably not the actual functional SNPs in this regard, but instead are in strong linkage disequilibrium with other causative variants yet to be identified.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 23782, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Evidence for direct involvement in pathways related to AD neuropathology is less apparent for other genes listed in Tables 2 and 3, with the exception of the histone deacetylase (HDAC) gene HDAC4.

They could act directly through pathways related to tau, indirectly through pathways related to beta-amyloid pathology (which, in turn influences tau), or through other mechanisms that affect brain reserve (e.g., neuronal or synaptic plasticity).
