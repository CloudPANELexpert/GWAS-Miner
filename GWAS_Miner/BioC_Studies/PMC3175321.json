Statins have been shown to cause both structural changes in skeletal muscle  and changes in gene expression in statin-tolerant patients .

This association with a wide variety of neuromuscular diseases suggests that statin therapy compromises the neuromuscular system. Therefore, identifying individuals who are at risk based on underlying genetic susceptibility and/or because of undiagnosed neuromuscular disease may potentially allow for the development of pharmacogenetic approaches to disease prevention.

Pravastatin was the only other cholesterol-lowering drug tested, and there was no association found in carriers of the SLCO1B1 variant. No other agents (rosuvastatin, lovastatin, or fluvastatin) have been evaluated as yet for an association with the SLCO1B1 variant. Therefore, the association we describe with EYS and severe statin myopathy across a variety of statins and dosages is the first that provides possible insight into a mechanism for statin myopathy.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 22936, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The possibility of population stratification cannot be ruled out, since we did not explicitly control for it in the study design. In this study, where cases are rare in the population and obtained from multiple centers, it was particularly difficult to obtain a hospital-based control group that perfectly represents the source population.

Our study also demonstrates that EYS gene products are complex, resulting from numerous alternative splicing patterns, and relatively abundant in the spinal cord in addition to the retina. A proposed mechanism for EYS gene involvement in severe statin myopathy is that loss of function variants may result in diminished capacity for the regeneration of damaged muscle. This biologic plausibility supports the EYS gene as a candidate gene for susceptibility to statin-induced myopathy that warrants further replication and functional study.", "sentences": [],
