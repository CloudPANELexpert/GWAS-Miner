We have previously described association between treatment emergent suicidal ideation (TESI) and markers in genes encoding the glutamate receptors GRIK2 and GRIA3. The present genome-wide association study was conducted to identify additional genetic markers associated with TESI that may help identify individuals at high-risk who may benefit from closer monitoring, alternative treatments, and/or specialty care. A clinically-representative cohort of outpatients with non-psychotic major depressive disorder enrolled in the Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression (STAR*D) trial were treated with citalopram under a standard protocol for up to 14 weeks. DNA samples from 90 white participants who developed TESI and a gender and race matched equal number of treated participants who denied any suicidal ideas were genotyped with 109,365 single nucleotide polymorphisms on the Illumina's Human-1 BeadChip. One marker was found to be associated with TESI in this sample at the experiment-wide adjusted p<0.05 level (marker rs11628713, allelic p= 6.2 x 10-7, OR = 4.7, permutation p=0.01). A second marker was associated at the experiment-wide adjusted p=0.06 level (rs10903034, allelic p = 3.02x 10-6, OR = 2.7, permutation p=0.06). These markers reside within the genes PAPLN and IL28RA, respectively. PAPLN encodes papilin, a protoglycan-like sulfated glycoprotein. IL28RA encodes an interleukin receptor.
