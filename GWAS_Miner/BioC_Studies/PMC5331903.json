To identify new susceptibility loci, we performed the largest genetic study of migraine to date, comprising 59,674 cases and 316,078 controls from 22 GWA studies. We identified 44 independent single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) significantly associated with migraine risk (P < 5 x 10-8) that map to 38 distinct genomic loci, including 28 loci not previously reported and the first locus identified on chromosome X.

There is debate about whether migraine is a disease of vascular dysfunction, or a result of neuronal dysfunction with vascular changes representing downstream effects not themselves causative of migraine. However, genetic evidence favoring one theory versus the other is lacking. At the phenotypic level, migraine is defined by diagnostic criteria from the International Headache Society.

with the prevalent types of migraine. Ten loci were previously reported (PubMed IDs listed) and 28 are newly found in this study. Each locus is labeled with protein coding genes that overlap the region. Intergenic loci are also labeled with the prefix \"near\" to highlight the additional uncertainty in identifying relevant genes. Effect sizes and P-values for each SNP were calculated for each study with an additive genetic model using logistic regression adjusted for sex and then combined in a fixed-effects meta-analysis. For loci that contain a secondary LD-independent signal passing genome-wide significance, the secondary index SNP and P-value is given. For the seven loci reaching genome-wide significance in the migraine without aura sub-type analysis, the corresponding index SNP and P-value are also given. Evidence for significant heterogeneity was found at four loci (TRPM8/HJURP, MRVI1, near ZCCHC14, and near CCM2L/HCK) so for those we present the results of a random-effects model.", "sentences": [],
