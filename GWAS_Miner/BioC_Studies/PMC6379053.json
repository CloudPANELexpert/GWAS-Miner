Nine Crohn's disease control samples were excluded because they were diagnosed with pancreatitis and also included in the case cohort. After exclusions this left 172 \"probable\" and \"definite\" cases, 80% of which had Crohn's disease.

Each of the three case and control cohorts used a different SNP genotyping chip. This has been reported to lead to spurious associations. Therefore, to avoid excessive false positive associations we focused subsequent association analyses on a very conservative subset of 2,819,700 SNPs that had an RSQ>0.95 in all three cohorts. For dedicated imputation of the HLA region we used SNP2HLA and imputed into the T1DGC reference panel of 5,224 individuals that have had classical HLA alleles typed as well as SNPs and indels by the immunochip. 8321 of the 8961 variants in the T1DGC panel were captured with an INFO score > 0.8. mach2dat was used to perform the association analyses for the genome-wide analysis, and PLINK was used to perform the association analyses for the HLA imputed analysis.
