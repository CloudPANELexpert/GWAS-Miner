In 2017 there will be approximately 22,440 newly diagnosed cases leading to 14,080 deaths in the United States. The overall high mortality seen in patients with EOC may be in large part due to 70% being diagnosed at an advanced stage. Treatment of patients with advanced stage EOC includes a combination of platinum based chemotherapy and cytoreductive surgery. A majority of patients will respond to this aggressive approach and achieve complete clinical remission. However, approximately 20% of patients will have platinum resistant disease and progress within six months of primary therapy. Patients who relapse within six months of completing initial treatment are classified as being primary platinum-resistant and have a poor response to secondary treatment with response rates of 7-12%. These patients are often not just resistant to platinum but resistant to all cytotoxic therapies making them chemotherapy resistant. Historically, patients with primary platinum-resistant disease have an estimated overall survival of 12 months from the time platinum resistance is identified. Patients who relapse >6 months following primary platinum therapy are termed platinum-sensitive and have better response to secondary platinum-based chemotherapy with response rates of 30-60% depending on the initial platinum free interval. Eventually, those patients with platinum-sensitive disease will develop resistance to platinum therapies and can be classified as acquired platinum-resistant.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 3447, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Mechanisms that underlie resistance to platinum chemotherapy are most likely multi-factorial. Broadly, resistance to anticancer platinum agents can be classified into two categories: first, platinum compounds may not reach intracellular levels needed for response due to inadequate delivery; and second, increased DNA damage repair mechanisms may lead to increased viability of tumor cells, and hence resistance. For example, carboplatin works by binding to DNA and forming DNA adducts leading to intrastrand or interstrand cross-links which disrupt the structure of the DNA molecule, leading to steric changes in the helix. Alteration in the structure of the DNA molecule leads to cellular DNA damage recognition and repair which can result in the continued viability of the cell resulting in platinum-resistance.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 4262, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Changes in front line schedule and delivery of chemotherapy, better supportive care and increased availability of effective agents for use at the time of recurrence have resulted in modest improvements in overall survival.
