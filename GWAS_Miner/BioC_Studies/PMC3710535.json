We conducted a GWAS among 1,116 subjects with Major Depressive Disorder from the Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression (STAR*D) trial who were characterized using Growth Mixture Modeling as showing a sustained versus unsustained pattern of clinical response over 12 weeks of treatment with citalopram. Replication analyses examined 585 subjects from the Genome-based Therapeutic Drugs for Depression (GENDEP) trial. The strongest association with sustained as opposed to unsustained response in STAR*D involved a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP; rs10492002) within the acyl-CoA synthetase short-chain family member 3 gene (ACSS3, p-value = 4.5 x 10-6, odds ratio = 0.61). No SNPs met our threshold for genome-wide significance. SNP data were available in GENDEP for 18 of the top 25 SNPs in STAR*D.

Because typical GWAS and gene-based analyses emphasize the most statistically significant individual variants, or genes, respectively, there is often less focus in complex traits on the combined effects of SNPs in functionally related genes. Recognizing this limitation, we sought to identify sets of genes and functional pathways enriched for stronger association signals than one would expect by chance. We utilized the web-based utility i-GSEA4GWAS for a gene set enrichment analysis and filtered the results for items with a false-discovery rate (FDR) <= 0.05. The canonical pathways which performed most strongly in the GWAS of unsustained responders versus sustained responders included: Alzheimer's disease, type I diabetes mellitus, the tumor necrosis factor pathway, antigen processing and presentation, long term potentiation, the mPR pathway, WNT signaling, and the GAQ pathway. Genes near SNPs with nominal association in the GWAS are shown in Supplemental Table 4 For example, we found that SNPs were nominally associated with our phenotype in 32 of 54 of the genes with testable variants in the KEGG long term potentiation pathway, including CACNA1C, GRM1, GRM5, GRIA1, GRIN2A, GRIN2B, GRIN2C, PRKACG, and PRKCA (FDR = 0.02).", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 25786, "infons": {"section_type": "RESULTS", "type": "title_3"}, "text": "Polygenic profile analysis", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 25813, "infons": {"section_type": "RESULTS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The risk score models in STAR*D included: 84,186 SNPs with p<= 0.5, 70,373 SNPs with p<= 0.4, 55,143 SNPs with p<= 0.3,38,521 SNPs with p<= 0.2, 20,213 SNPs with p <= 0.1, 2,091 SNPs with p <= 0.01, and 182 SNPs with p <= 0.001.

There is no overlap between the top findings from this analysis and our previous GWAS of citalopram response in the STAR*D sample, suggesting that our approach is not simply differentiating responders from non-responders as identified using a primary clinical endpoint. Instead, by comparing response trajectory phenotypes, we may be identifying genetic determinants of a subset of drug response that is unsustained over the first several months of treatment.

Our attempt to replicate the very top findings from our GWAS in an independent sample yielded no significant finding given the number of SNPs tested in the GENDEP dataset. A joint analysis of the two samples using 18 of the top STAR*D SNPs that could be genotyped or imputed in GENDEP provided modest additional support for the ACSS3 SNPs, while showing increasing support for a SNP in CSGALNACT1. Regarding CSGALNACT1, it may be of interest to note that in a previous GWAS in GENDEP, the strongest reported association with antidepressant response (to nortriptyline) was with a SNP in another chondroitin sulfate related gene, uronyl 2-sulfotransferase (UST). While chondroitin sulfate has a well established role in the skeletal system (cf Vangsness 2009 PMID 19111223), there is evidence that it may also play a regulatory role in neuroplasticity, regeneration, and brain development processes. In a murine knock-out model, the absence of CSGALNACT1 has been reported to alter cortical thickness, potentially by altering cell migration patterns.

Interestingly, major ancestry vectors were not associated with the response phenotype, unlike in our previous studies of general response or remission on citalopram. Our genomic inflation factor (1.0, mean chi-squared = 0.96) suggests no systematic inflation of statistics that would be expected by hidden population structure.

Similarly, while our data could be construed as not supporting the role of common genetic variation in antidepressant response durability, this conclusion may be premature. We found that the direction of effect was concordant between STAR*D and GENDEP significantly more often than expected, suggesting that our lack of genome-wide significance may be related to the limited sample sizes.
