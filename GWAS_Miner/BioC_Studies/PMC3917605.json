Expression of NPC1 was significantly correlated with TG levels both in human and mouse adipose tissue. In the mouse adipose tissue, expression levels were also significantly correlated with HDL-C, unesterified cholesterol, and non-HDL-C (data not shown). NPC1 is a transmembrane protein containing a sterol-sensing domain that participates in cholesterol trafficking from the late endosome/lysosome to the plasma membrane. Rare mutations in NPC1 cause an autosomal recessive disorder, Niemann-Pick type C disease (MIM 257220), characterized by accumulation of unesterified cholesterol and other lipids in late endosomes and lysosomes. NPC patients often have low levels of HDL-C, LDL-C, and TC, while their TG levels tend to be increased. A nonsynonymous variant in NPC1 was associated with early-onset and morbid adult obesity in a GWA study of European descent. The association with plasma TG levels is beyond the NPC1-obesity association, since the signal of association persisted after the confounding effect of BMI was controlled in our statistical analyses. NPC1 gene is regulated through the sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP) pathway, suggesting that the NPC1 protein plays a central role in maintaining lipid homeostasis. Evidence derived from animal models shows that NPC1 haploinsufficiency results in weight gain, adipocyte hypertrophy, hepatic steatosis, impaired fasting glucose, glucose intolerance, hyperinsulinemia, hyperleptinemia, and hypertriglyceridemia. Since NPC1-deficient cells fail to deliver LDL-derived free cholesterol to mitochondria and ER, they have impaired synthesis of endogenous liver X receptor (LXR) ligands and LXR target genes are downregulated. These changes may stimulate de novo lipogenesis and result in TG synthesis. Alternatively, decreased intracellular free cholesterol concentrations in NPC1-deficient cells could lead to SREBP activation and increased de novo lipogenesis.

Furthermore, rs964184 failed to regulate the gene expression levels of the APOA1/C3/A4/A5 cluster genes or other nearby genes (i.e. cis-expression quantitative trait loci) in large human tissue samples from liver and fat. However, several studies have demonstrated postprandial TG levels as a risk factor for CHD. Our data show that postprandially the TG-increasing allele (G) group had a significantly lower serum apoAV response than the common allele carriers (C), demonstrating for the first time a direct link between rs964184 and serum apoAV protein levels. Given these functional data and the fact that rs964184 is not in LD with other regional variants in Mexicans, we speculate a regulatory mechanism of action for this variant responsive to the postprandial state. Several nuclear receptors involved in energy metabolism are known to regulate APOA5 expression (e.g. FXR and PPARa), and recently an orphan nuclear receptor Nur77 has also been shown to bind and regulate the human APOA5 promoter region, suggesting that there might be other regulatory factors and elements of APOA5 that have not been identified as of yet. Furthermore, the molecular mechanisms by which apoAV regulates plasma TG in vivo is still debated. It has been suggested that apoAV (1) enhances the catabolism of TG-rich lipoproteins by LPL or (2) it inhibits the rate of production of VLDL. Our data supports the stimulation of LPL-mediated removal of TG-rich lipoproteins mechanism. Taken together, the regional cross-ethnic LD comparison and functional data pinpoint rs964184 as the causative variant underlying the GWA signal as well as suggest postprandial transcriptional regulation as a plausible molecular mechanism for this TG and CHD-GWA variant. This potential mechanism of action warrants investigation in future functional studies.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 25272, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The unique LD architecture of Mexicans enabled us to significantly reduce the associated region of three European GWA loci for TGs: APOA5, CILP2, and MLXIPL. In the CILP2 region that has also shown genome-wide significant associations for CHD, the strongest signal in Mexicans was obtained with rs2228603, a missense variant in the NCAN gene. Importantly, in a recent European GWA for fatty liver disease, this SNP was genome-wide significant for hepatic steatosis with the same T risk allele as in Mexicans. Fatty liver disease is characterized by increased accumulation of fat, especially TGs, in the liver cells, and is associated with increased TGs.

As rs2278426 is a missense variant (R59W), predicted to be damaging in LOC55908, the association data in Mexicans also revealed the putative functional variant and gene underlying this uncharacterized GWA signal. However, it should be noted that only a limited number of loci associated with HDL-C have also been shown to be associated with CHD, challenging the concept that raising of plasma HDL-C would uniformly translate into reductions in risk of myocardial infarction.

Furthermore, since the European lead variants typically represent tag-SNPs rather than the actual functional variants, another possible explanation for non-generalization is differences in the surrounding LD. Accordingly, we detected more regional differences in LD patterns between the CEU and MEX populations of HapMapIII at the non-generalized than at the generalized loci (52% versus 32%).

These inter-population differences in allele frequency can lead to association signals at different SNPs in different populations which do not necessarily mean that the causal variant is also population specific.

These significance thresholds were used as higher P-values are unlikely to reach the genome-wide significance level in the combined stage1 and 2 analysis given the sample size. Furthermore, a more stringent selection criterion (P<=8.0x10-04) was applied in the association analysis of hypertriglyceridemia with imputed SNPs because of the imputation uncertainty. We employed multivariate logistic regression using an additive genetic model to analyze the hypertriglyceridemia affection status, as the study case-control samples were specifically ascertained based on the TG levels, and multivariate linear regression with sex as a covariate to assess the effects of the SNPs on continuous log transformed HDL-C levels. Continuous TC levels were also analyzed to examine the association of 48 European-GWA SNPs for TC and LDL-C levels. Subjects with trait levels more than 4 standard deviations from the mean or on lipid lowering therapy at the time of the blood drawing were excluded from the quantitative analyses. TC and HDL-C levels were also adjusted for the hypertriglyceridemia affection status in order to avoid possible sampling bias. Association analyses of the genotyped SNPs were performed using the PLINK software, and the imputed SNPs were analyzed using the expectation-maximization (EM) option in SNPTEST v2.1.1 software in order to incorporate the imputation uncertainties in the regression models described above. Association analyses of the secondary phenotype HDL-C were also performed using SPREG, which further accounts for the non-random sampling of the cases and controls by incorporating the known disease prevalence. A hypertriglyceridemia prevalence of 25% was used in the SPREG regression models, because in all stage 1 cases serum TG levels were above the 75th age-sex specific Mexican percentile.
