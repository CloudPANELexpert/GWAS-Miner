The peak associations observed in our study (i.e., rs495366, rs603050, rs11225434 and rs7926920) were also located in the upstream region of MMP-1 gene, consistent with the existence of functional variants in the MMP-1 promoter region affecting expression. However, further studies are needed to verify this speculation given that the previously reported promoter polymorphisms were not highly correlated with our most strongly associated SNP (i.e. rs495366) based on the HAPMAP Caucasian population or with other associated SNPs in the MMP-1 upstream region. The absence of an association between intragenic MMP-1 SNPs and serum MMP-1 levels is possibly due to suboptimal SNP coverage of the MMP-1 gene by the Affymetrix 500K panel given that this panel includes only 3 SNPs within MMP-1 despite the fact that this gene spans a region of 8,243 bp.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 23434, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Our analyses do not permit us to resolve whether the observed associations are attributable to a single functional SNP or to multiple functional SNPs residing in the MMP gene cluster.

Including rs11226373, which is partially correlated with the other two SNPs, in the haplotype analysis did not provide a clear dose-response relationship with MMP-1 serum levels.

For example, the expression of MMP-1 is elevated in human atherosclerotic plaques, particularly in shoulder regions and areas of foam cell accumulation in the plaques, and is higher in plaques with thin cap compared to those with a thick fibrous cap. Foam cells isolated from rabbit aortic lesions are capable of synthesizing and releasing MMP-1 constitutively in vitro. Furthermore, treating patients with carotid endarterectomy with MMP inhibitor reduces the MMP-1 concentration in carotid plaques. These findings suggest a critical role of MMP-1 in the matrix degradation that predisposes plaque rupture and acute coronary syndromes.

In two relatively small studies, higher plasma MMP-1 serum levels were correlated with increasing carotid-femoral pulse-wave velocity (PWV), a marker of arterial stiffness and with increasing pulse pressure and mean blood pressure while in our large study, we observed significant, albeit modest, correlations of MMP-1 levels with fasting triglycerides and pulse pressure.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 26493, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Only a few studies have reported correlations of circulating MMP-1 levels with CHD outcomes.

One of the key MMPs is MMP-1, although the relation of circulating MMP-1 levels to cardiovascular risk and its potential value as a biomarker for screening for disease is unknown. To identify genetic determinants of MMP-1 serum levels, we carried out a genome-wide association study in 778 healthy Old Order Amish individuals. We found serum MMP-1 levels to be highly heritable in this population (h2 = 81%). We identified a large cluster of SNPs spanning an 11.5 Mb region on chromosome 11q to be strongly associated with serum MMP-1 levels, with the peak association observed with rs495366 (p = 5.73 x 10-34; minor allele frequency = 0.36).

However, there was little evidence that the MMP-1-associated SNPs were associated with any other cardiovascular risk factors in this relatively healthy population.
