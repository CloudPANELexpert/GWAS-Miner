BIP and MDD have in common major depressive episodes with BIP distinguished by the additional presence of manic (bipolar 1) or hypomanic episodes (bipolar 2). Genetic epidemiological and genome-wide linkage studies are also consistent with overlap between genetic risk factors for both disorders. To attempt to identify common genetic risk factors, we conducted a meta-analysis combining data from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of BIP (4,387 cases and 6,209 controls) and MDD (1,695 cases and 1,761 controls).", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 730, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Ascertainment, diagnostic assessment, genotyping, quality control, and analysis are detailed elsewhere.

Most cases met criteria for DSM-IV bipolar 1 (81%) with smaller numbers meeting criteria for bipolar 2 (16%), schizoaffective disorder/manic type (2%), or bipolar NOS (1%). After quality control, 1,769,948 SNPs were analyzed (18.7% directly genotyped and the remainder imputed using HapMap2 CEU). Cases meeting DSM-IV criteria for MDD were ascertained from clinical and community sources, and controls at low liability for MDD were selected from a community sample. Genotyping was conducted by Perlegen using a 600K platform. Following quality control (with slightly stricter thresholds to maximize comparability), 1,893,617 SNPs were available (20.4% directly genotyped with the rest imputed using HapMap2 CEU). In both studies, SNPs were dropped for excessive missingness, low minor allele frequencies, and marked deviations from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Subjects were removed for excessive missingness, unusual genome-wide heterozygosity, first- or second-degree relation to any other subject, and if empirical ancestry deviated markedly from other subjects.

These SNPs reached genome-wide significance in the initial BIP report and multiple SNPs in this region had p < 0.05 in the MDD study.

Second, two ANK3 SNPs exceeded genome-wide significance in the initial BIP report but were not supported in the MDD GWAS (rs10994336 and rs10994338 with p-values ~0.9). Third, support for the PCLO SNP of particular interest in the MDD GWAS (rs2522843) was not increased with meta-analysis although several SNPs had p-values < 0.05. Fourth, as shown in Table S1, several areas were of modest significance in each primary GWAS and considerably greater significance in the meta-analysis (although none reached the genome-wide significance level): intergenic regions on chr2:175.95-175.99 Mb and chr13:49.96-49.98 Mb along with SNPs in SYNE1, FAT4, DMTF1, C7orf23, and C15orf53.

Among the possible explanations, genetic variation in CACNA1C might be common, subtle, and pleomorphic risk factors for mood disorders. Alternatively, the overlap could be due to misclassification - e.g., if some portion of the MDD group were truly \"bipolar-like\" but misclassified due to diagnostic or nosological error (despite the use of standard and careful methodologies) or if some portion of the BIP group was similarly misclassified. In contrast, the bipolar risk locus ANK3 did not find support in this meta-analysis suggesting that its effect may be specific to BIP or that power was insufficient to detect an effect. Finally, our analysis had insufficient power definitively to establish or to exclude the role of several biologically interesting candidate genes (e.g., PCLO and SYNE1), and further insights into their roles in mood disorders await larger-scale mega-analyses.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 5556, "infons": {"section_type": "SUPPL", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "Supplementary Material", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 5579, "infons": {"section_type": "SUPPL", "type": "footnote"}, "text": "           Author Contributions         ", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 5620, "infons": {"section_type": "SUPPL", "type": "footnote"}, "text": "All authors reviewed and approved the final version of the manuscript.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 5691, "infons": {"section_type": "SUPPL", "type": "footnote"}, "text": "           Conflicts of Interest         ", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 5733, "infons": {"section_type": "SUPPL", "type": "footnote"}, "text": "In the interests of full disclosure, Dr. Sullivan reports receiving unrestricted research funding from Eli Lilly for genetic research in schizophrenia.
