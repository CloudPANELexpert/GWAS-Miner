All three loci were selected for replication in an unbiased manner on the basis of the results of the meta-analysis (Supplementary Table 2). The rs1800693[T] allele associated with increased risk of MS (odds ratio (OR) = 1.20, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.10-1.31, in the replication stage) is found within the sixth intron of TNFRSF1A, and thus we refer to this region as the TNFRSF1A locus. Another gene, PLEKHG6, is found within the block of LD that contains rs1800693, so, formally, either or both genes could be associated with MS susceptibility (Fig. 2a). However, none of the SNPs that are in LD with rs1800693 are located within the PLEKHG6 gene region (Fig. 2a); future fine-mapping efforts and follow-up studies will be needed to definitively resolve the functional basis of this association. Nonetheless, current literature supports a role for TNFRSF1A, as it has previously been implicated in tumor necrosis factor-associated periodic syndrome (TRAPS). This rare syndrome consists of recurrent episodes of systemic inflammation with variable symptoms including fever, abdominal pain, myalgia, arthralgia, exanthema and ocular involvement, and many affected individuals have been shown to have one of over 57 coding or noncoding mutations in TNFRSF1A (see URLs section in Online Methods). Most of these alleles are rare variants found in certain pedigrees, but a few less-penetrant alleles are segregating in European populations at < 0.05 frequency. Notably, a number of subjects with demyelinating or demyelinating-like diseases have been recently reported to harbor such variants (such as the R92Q substitution), but the slight excess in the proportion of these polymorphisms in MS subjects was not significant. In our meta-analysis, only the R92Q polymorphism (rs4149584, labeled R121Q in dbSNP) has been analyzed. It has substantial evidence of association with MS susceptibility in the meta-analysis (P = 0.0003) as well as the replication effort (P = 0.0042), and it is not in LD with rs1800693 (r2 = 0.041 in HapMap CEU samples), the common TNFRSF1A variant identified in our study (Table 2). Conditional analysis suggests that the two SNPs represent independent associations (Supplementary Table 4). Although a detailed investigation of common and rare variants in this locus is necessary to fully characterize MS-related effects, our study provides the first definitive link between the TNFRSF1A locus and susceptibility to demyelinating disease at both a high-frequency polymorphism of modest effect (rs1800693) and a low-frequency polymorphism of stronger effect (rs4149584).

On the centromeric side, this SNP is located within 61 kb of IRF8 (interferon response factor 8; also known as interferon consensus sequence binding protein 1, ICSBP1), and we therefore refer to this association as being in the IRF8 locus because the closest telomeric gene, FOXF1, is 526 kb away. As its name implies, IRF8 is one of the several transcription factors that regulate responses to type I interferons (alpha and beta interferons) by binding the interferon-stimulated response element (ISRE) (MIM601565).

The excess of extreme results with modest LD (0.8 > r2 > 0.5) to rs17824933 at the telomeric end of the block of LD suggests that there may be an independent association within this locus. CD6, like CD58, is a molecule involved in T-cell costimulation and differentiation; it may therefore have a role in modulating the activation and proliferation of T cells in the context of an inflammatory disease. In fact, these properties led to its targeting with a blocking monoclonal antibody in a clinical trial treating individuals with MS. Finally, the soluble form of CD6 may also function as a pattern recognition receptor and affects the serum level of TNFalpha in this context in mice.

On the other hand, the signal of association within the OLIG3-TNFAIP3 locus seems to be distinct from known associations to psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) (Supplementary Table 5a). Given the discovery of these strong candidate MS loci, we extended this comparative analysis to a larger number of loci by comparing our list of 100 top MS loci selected for replication (Supplementary Table 2) to the list of 76 Crohn's disease loci in which replication was attempted. We found seven loci with substantial evidence of association in both diseases: these include not only loci with a validated role in one disease (IL12B and PTGER4 in Crohn's disease as well as IRF8 in MS) but also loci with suggested roles in both diseases (BCL2, NEDD4L, PPA2 and STAT3; Supplementary Table 5b).", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 14253, "infons": {"section_type": "RESULTS", "type": "title_2"}, "text": "Expression studies", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 14272, "infons": {"section_type": "RESULTS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Given the newly discovered association to the IRF8 locus that contains an important transcription factor involved in responses to type I interferons, we explored its possible functional consequences by investigating a set of RNA data (Affymetrix U133 2.0 array) captured from the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of 240 subjects of European ancestry with either remitting-relapsing MS (RRMS, n = 230) or a clinically isolated demyelinating syndrome (CIS, n = 10), many of which go on to develop MS (Supplementary Table 1c). These subjects can be classified into three categories: untreated subjects (n = 82), interferon beta (IFNbeta)-treated subjects (n = 94) and glatiramer acetate (GA)-treated subjects (n = 64). We used an unbiased approach to assess these data for the hypothesis that the IRF8 locus may have a modest but broad effect on RNA expression from genes involved in interferon response. Specifically, we applied a gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) methodology to explore the results of a quantitative trait (eQTL) analysis correlating rs17445836 with our genome-wide RNA expression data from subjects with MS and CIS. As IRF8 is known to be an interferon-response gene, its function could be affected either by IFNbeta treatment or by GA treatment, which is reported to suppress IFNbeta expression (S. Zamvil, University of California, San Francisco, personal communication). Thus, we pursued this GSEA screen of RNA data separately in each of our three subject subsets (untreated, IFNbeta-treated and GA-treated). Sixteen gene sets that meet our threshold of significance (an FDR q value < 0.05) have genes that are coordinately upregulated in the presence of the rs17445836[G] allele in both the untreated and the IFNbeta-treated subject subsets. Specifically, each of the 16 shared gene sets contain genes whose expression is coordinately enhanced under an additive model for rs17445836[G] association. In Table 3, we present the most associated of these 16 gene sets, that is, those gene sets that have an FDR q value < 0.001 in both sets of subjects. All eight of these most associated gene sets are primarily defined as being interferon-responding or are known to contain responses to type I interferons. Detailed results of each analysis are presented in Supplementary Table 6a,b online. Upregulation of interferon pathway genes in peripheral blood has previously been noted in ~50% of untreated subjects with MS, so the overlap between the untreated and IFNbeta-treated subsets suggests that these results are consistent with our current knowledge of pathophysiology in MS. The lack of replication of the results of the untreated group in the GA-treated group is intriguing; it could be due to the smaller size of this subject subset (n = 64) and/or the suppression of IFNbeta expression by GA. Further validation experiments in these subject subsets are needed to confirm our observations and explore the interactions of these MS treatments with the effect of the rs17445836[G] allele.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 17294, "infons": {"section_type": "RESULTS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "To control for potential bias in our analysis method, we repeated this investigation of the quantitative trait analysis results using the Ingenuity Pathways Analysis software suite (see URLs section in Online Methods).

A phase II clinical trial with a TNFRSF1A:IgG1 fusion protein (lenercept) also reported increased clinical attacks, although these occurred in the absence of enhanced disease activity on magnetic-resonance imaging and disability. Furthermore, demyelinating lesions are a possible adverse event in subjects with Crohn's disease or rheumatoid arthritis treated with monoclonal antibodies to TNFalpha. Thus, genetic and functional data now merge and suggest that dysregulation of the TNFalpha pathway has a role in the onset of MS, with diminished TNFalpha activity being associated with onset of CNS inflammatory lesions in clinical data. The suggested association of the OLIG3-TNFAIP3 locus fits within this theme, as may the association of CD6: soluble CD6 may function as a pattern recognition receptor and influence circulating levels of TNFalpha. With its observations relating to responses to class I interferons and TNFalpha, this study focuses our attention on dysregulation within the innate immune system in MS susceptibility. Dysfunction of the innate immune system, an important first line of defense against pathogens, has long been noted in immunopathology studies of MS.

(a) Illustration of the TNFRSF1A locus, with the local recombination rate plotted in light blue over this 200-kb chromosomal segment centered on rs1800693. Each diamond represents one SNP found in this locus, and the most associated SNP in the meta-analysis, rs1800693, is marked by a red diamond. A blue diamond is used to represent the level of evidence associated with rs1800693 in the joint analysis that includes the replication data. The color of each circle is defined by the extent of LD with rs1800693: red (r2 > 0.8), orange (0.8 > r2 > 0.5), gray (0.5 > r2 > 0.3) and white (r2 > 0.3). Physical positions are based on build 36 of the human genome. rs1800693 is located in an intron of TNFRSF1A. (b) Illustration of the IRF8 locus, with the most associated SNP in this locus, rs17445836, highlighted by red (meta-analysis result) and blue (joint analysis result) diamonds. Here, we also present all SNPs found within a 200-kb window centered on rs17445836 and define SNP colors based on LD to rs17445836. (c) Illustration of the CD6 locus, with the most associated SNP in this locus, rs17824933, highlighted by red (meta-analysis result) and blue (joint analysis result) diamonds. Here, we also present all SNPs found within a 200-kb window centered on rs17824933 and define SNP colors based on LD to rs17824933.
