White matter plays an important a role in several neurological diseases and psychiatric disorders, which are phenotypes that also have substantial but poorly characterized, genetic components. There is increasing evidence that compromised white matter microstructure is part of the inherited risk for these disorders, as indicated by reduced FA in unaffected relatives, and polygenic risk score analysis.

This supports our finding that GNA13 transcript levels were significantly associated with both our top SNP and with global FA suggesting that the g-protein alpha 13 subunit mediates an effect of rs10853057 on white matter development or maintenance. There are several conceivable mechanisms through which variation in GNA13 could affect white matter microstructure. For example, the g-proteins defined by the alpha 13 and 12 subunits interact directly with RhoGEFs, which in turn interact with RhoA, which is thought to regulate myelination and axon growth.

However, there was only a phenotypic - but no genotypic - correlation between the transcript and FA, suggesting that HTR7 expression influences white matter microstructure, but it is unclear whether this effect is driven by secondary genetic or environmental factors (for example circadian rhythms). Our observation may be due to our lack of power to detect genetic correlation between HTR7 expression levels and global FA due to the relatively low heritability of HTR7 gene expression in lymphocytes. The serotonin system has been a major interest in behavioral neuroscience and neuropharmacology, and observations of knock-out animals and experiments with specific antagonists have demonstrated that HTR7 is involved in mood regulation, circadian rhythms, and depressive behavior. Interestingly, HTR7 couples to g-protein alpha s and alpha 12 subunits, the amino acid sequence of the latter being very similar to the alpha 13 subunit, with a similar potential to activate RhoA proteins.

Firstly, the polygenic nature of complex traits and the extremely high statistical penalty for multiple testing across the genome undoubtedly leads to a large number of unreported false negative SNPs, which likely include some previously hypothesized variants in candidate genes.
