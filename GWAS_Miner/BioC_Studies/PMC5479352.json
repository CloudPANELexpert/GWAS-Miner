In the candidate gene literature, genes in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, as well as the serotonergic and dopaminergic systems have been well investigated but show little evidence of consistent findings (reviewed in). This is likely due to low power, population differences, sample heterogeneity, or phenotypic assessment. For these same reasons, the six GWAS on PTSD have been similarly contradictory. For instance, Logue and colleagues identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in retinoic acid receptor-related orphan receptor A (RORA) that were associated with PTSD in a sample of combat-exposed EAs and a smaller sample of combat-exposed AAs.

While the AI data was sequenced, only common variants were analyzed here, as was the goal of the study; however, larger sample sizes can be used in the future to detect genetic effects in rare variants. Similarly, while imputation was used in the MA data, only variants in LD with exonic SNPs were imputed by the nature of the data and thus important signals may have been missed. However, our MA and AI cohorts are unique, high-risk samples, which in itself is both a strength and limitation of the current study: these samples are distinctive, comprised of a non-combat exposed, minority, primarily young adult population whom have a unique risk for PTSD.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 27074, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "In conclusion, the present study provides evidence that genetic variation in genes influencing olfaction may confer risk for PTSD in these minority populations. Although this study was underpowered to fully evaluate the phenotype given the limitation of small sample size, suggestive evidence for genetic association was nevertheless found in both cohorts. Specifically, variation in OR11L1 was associated with PTSD in a young adult MA sample and a signal in the nearby olfactory receptor OR2L13 on chromosome 1 was nominally associated with PTSD in the AI sample. Pathway analysis using both cohorts showed enrichment of functional terms related to the olfactory system, particularly signal transduction, olfactory receptor activity, GPCRs and olfaction. This is in agreement with findings from a functional interaction network derived from GWAS findings on PTSD in which olfactory transduction and olfactory signaling pathway were top pathways in one of the associated modules identified, as well as numerous clinical studies supporting a role for olfaction in PTSD . These data suggest that olfaction may play a role in PTSD, but may not necessarily mean that variants in the same olfactory genes contribute risk for PTSD across populations.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 28319, "infons": {"section_type": "SUPPL", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "Supplementary Material", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 28342, "infons": {"section_type": "SUPPL", "type": "footnote"}, "text": "           Conflicts of interest         ", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 28384, "infons": {"section_type": "SUPPL", "type": "footnote"}, "text": "None.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 28390, "infons": {"section_type": "SUPPL", "type": "footnote"}, "text": "           Supplementary material         ", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 28433, "infons": {"section_type": "SUPPL", "type": "footnote"}, "text": "Supplementary material is available on the Cambridge Journals Online website.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 28511, "infons": {"section_type": "SUPPL", "type": "footnote"}, "text": "           Role of the funding source         ", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 28558, "infons": {"section_type": "SUPPL", "type": "footnote"}, "text": "This research was supported by grants from the National Institute on Alcoholism and Alcohol Abuse (NIAAA; grants AA010201 and AA006420 to C.L.E. and AA013525 to E.P.R.) and the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA; grant DA030976 to K.C.W. and C.L.E.) of the National Institutes of Health.
