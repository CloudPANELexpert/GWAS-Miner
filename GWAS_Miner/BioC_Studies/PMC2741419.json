(The region covered on chromosome 16 is 1.4Mb long since it is close to the telomere). Any SNP not associated with melanoma (p>0.01) was eliminated, and SNPs were thinned such that no pair had r2>0.8. This left 50 SNPs from a total set of 480. The model assumed an additive effect on the logistic scale at the locus of interest, and analyses were adjusted for geographical region (as previously defined). Chromosomal regions were analysed separately and in combination, and the analysis included either every individual or was restricted to individuals with complete genotyping at the markers being analysed. At each step of the forward-selection procedure, the global significance of the model was evaluated, as was the significance of the new marker. The criteria for accepting a new marker were p <0.001 for each marker included in the model from the likelihood ratio test and a decrement in the global p-value of the model. Of the 5456 individuals in the dataset, 4959 (90.9%) had complete genotyping. The stepwise regression was conducted using Stata.
