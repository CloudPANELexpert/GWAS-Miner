There was no apparent geographical heterogeneity in the allele frequencies of rs402710. Adjustment for smoking exposure (pack years) had no effect on the observed association with a smoking-adjusted OR per allele of 1.19 (1.12-1.26). We also investigated rs402710 in the context of smoking intensity among controls and did not observe any association between number of cigarettes consumed per day and rs402710 (p = 0.74).

We found little LD between rs402710 and rs2736100 using all available controls.

Finally, when we imputed genotypes (Supplementary Methods) at 5p15.33 in the 2,971 cases of lung cancer and 3,746 controls with genome-wide data, we did not identify any SNPs more strongly associated with risk than rs402710 (Supplementary Table 3 online). The top 11 imputed SNPs (P < 0.0001) were genotyped subsequently in the cases and controls of central European ancestry (Supplementary Methods) and comparison of haplotype frequencies from this direct genotyping indicated that the prevalence of two distinct haplotypes differed between cases and controls (Supplementary Table 4 online). One haplotype carried the minor allele of rs402710 and eight additional SNPs in high LD (r2 > 0.644) with rs402710, and the second haplotype tagged the minor allele of both rs2736100 and a second SNP rs2736098.

There is no clear evidence to suggest that rs2736100 or rs402710 are themselves causative alleles. The rs2736100 variant is located in intron 1 of TERT, and rs402710 is located in a region of high LD that includes the proximal and putative promoter regions of TERT, as well as the entire coding region of the CLPTM1L gene (Supplementary Fig. 3). Current knowledge of the role of these genes would seem to implicate TERT as the more plausible candidate. TERT is the reverse transcriptase component of telomerase, making it essential for telomerase enzyme production and maintenance of telomeres. The telomerase enzyme is responsible for telomere regeneration, and up to 90% of human tumor samples, including lung cancer, show telomerase activity, indicating that regeneration of telomeres is a vital step for most forms of carcinogenesis. TERT expression is actively present in germ cells, although is found in very low levels for most types of normal cells. Activation of the TERT promoter seems to be a key step in synthesis of the TERT protein and resulting telomerase activity. Such activity may be measured with the telomeric repeat amplification protocol (TRAP) and has been associated with both lung cancer progression and prognosis. Inhibitors of TERT are clearly of much interest for potential chemo-prevention and treatment of cancer, although their development has so far been unsuccessful. DNA resequencing has shown that there is little common genetic variation in the TERT coding region which, along with its high conservation between species, implies that the gene itself is under strong evolutionary restraint. Rare mutations in the TERT coding sequence have been implicated in dyskeratosis congenita, an autosomal dominant syndrome characterized by bone marrow abnormalities, but also pulmonary fibrosis and increased risk of some cancers.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 8278, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The other gene in this region, CLPTM1L, named for its similarity to a gene implicated in susceptibility to cleft lip palate, was identified through screening for cisplatin (CDDP) resistance-related genes and was found to be upregulated in CDDP-resistant ovarian tumor cell lines and to induce apoptosis in CDDP-sensitive cells.
