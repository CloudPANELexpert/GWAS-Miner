HLA-Cw7 is inclusive of the PSORS1 region (which is associated with psoriasis). In the present study, associations in this region were found for rs3130544 and rs7750641. The functional effects of these candidate genes within PSORS1 may relate to stimulation of receptors for class I MHC and dysfunction of natural killer (NK) or T cell self tolerance. A combination of class I MHC and ligand (on NK or T cells) may augment susceptibility to autoimmune injury during pregnancy.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 21863, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Cardiac neonatal lupus was also associated with non-HLA regions, including loci at 21q22, 12q21, 1q31, and 10p15. A cluster of associated SNPs at 21q22 is in proximity to ERG-ETS2/WDR4. ERG is a transcription factor that serves as a \"brake\" to both apoptosis and inflammation, components previously described in the cascade to injury and replacement of the atrioventricular node by fibrosis. Yi and coworkers demonstrated that ERG protects fibroblasts against apoptosis induced by serum deprivation. Recently, Yuan and coworkers demonstrated that ERG plays a role in repressing the expression of interleukin-8 (IL-8), a mediator of inflammatory cell accumulation produced by numerous cell types, including macrophages and fibroblasts. In addition, it has been demonstrated that ERG plays a role in augmenting the expression of transforming growth factor beta (TGFbeta) receptor type II. Thus, a polymorphism associated with low expression or diminished function of the encoded protein may represent the absence of a needed protective factor for fetuses exposed to maternal anti-Ro/SSA antibodies.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 22960, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "In psoriasis, risk alleles also reside at non-HLA genes such as chromosomes 1 and 5, which include IL23R and IL13, respectively. Although they did not reach genome-wide significance, SNPs associated with each of these genes were associated with cardiac neonatal lupus. IL-13 is a prototypic Th2 cytokine that is also strongly profibrotic. Mice deficient in IL-13 are protected against a fluorescein isothiocyanate-induced model of lung fibrosis, and IL-13 can stimulate fibroblast collagen production independently of TGFbeta. However, it has recently been demonstrated that signaling through IL-13Ralpha2, initially thought to be a decoy receptor for IL-13, results in the production of TGFbeta. Moreover, in vivo gene silencing of IL-13Ralpha2 using small interfering RNA attenuates bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis, with decreases in TGFbeta1 secretion and collagen formation.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 23839, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "In this passively acquired autoimmune disease, with the exception of HLA, there were no significant genome-wide associations with identified polymorphisms that have been implicated in other autoimmune diseases, such as SLE, in which there are genetic contributions relating to dysfunction of the acquired immune system. Overall, however, there was an inflation factor of 1.22 for these autoimmune SNPs in cardiac neonatal lupus, compared with an inflation factor of 1.01 for the entire genome. Specifically, the enrichment of a variant of IRF5 is intriguing, and the variation at 7q32 has attracted a substantial amount of attention. However, it is acknowledged that maternal inheritance may account for some of these genes for which the associations are just below the level of significance. There are several possible and non-mutually exclusive interpretations. First, the associations may simply reflect the maternal enrichment of the genome for autoimmunity risk alleles, given the autoantibody state of the mother. Second, there may be an enrichment in autoimmunity-predisposing risk alleles in children with cardiac neonatal lupus independent of the maternal state. Third, there may be no significant enrichment, consistent with the relative immaturity of the human fetal immune system, which relies almost exclusively on adaptive maternal immunity, and the genetic contribution to cardiac injury may be restricted to the innate immune system and tissue reactivity.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 25313, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "These data require careful consideration and recognition of their inferential limits.

TDT will be informative. The limited power of the study is another limitation. However, the strength of the study is in the precise clinical phenotyping of the cases, with 96% having advanced atrioventricular block, the most characteristic cardiac manifestation associated with maternal anti-Ro/SSA antibodies. Given the rarity of the disease, the study included 4 cases of first-degree block, persisting after birth in 3 as shown by EKG, suggesting sustained injury, and 1 case of isolated cardiomyopathy.
