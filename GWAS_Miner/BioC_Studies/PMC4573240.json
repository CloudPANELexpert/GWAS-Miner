A number of warfarin dosing algorithms, comprising genetic and nongenetic covariates emerged from these studies, but their predictive power accounts for no more than 60% of the variance in warfarin dose requirements in ambulatory patients. Pharmacogenetic polymorphisms in VKORC1 and CYP2C9 affecting, respectively, warfarin's pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics are the most informative covariates in most algorithms. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of warfarin dosing requirements in White/Caucasian, Japanese and African-American patients indicated that common SNPs with large effects on warfarin dose are unlikely to be discovered outside of the CYP2C9 and VKORC1 genes. However, the possibility that polymorphisms in other pharmacogenes may contribute in a smaller scale to the interindividual variance in warfarin dosing, may not be excluded. In this respect, conditional analyses and GWA or meta-analytic efforts including larger sample sizes may uncover novel common variants with smaller effect sizes. Indeed, a polymorphism in CYP4F2 (rs2108622) reached genome-wide significant association with warfarin dose after conditioning for VKORC1 and CYP2C9 polymorphisms. Another study in African-Americans applied a stepwise conditional analysis and identified an association between a polymorphism in the CYP2C cluster on chromosome 10 (rs12777823) and warfarin dose. In the present study, we applied the extreme discordant phenotype (EDP) methodology to select Brazilian patients under stable warfarin therapy for a genome-wide association study. The EDP approach contrasts the most sensitive and the most resistant phenotype groups, which in the case of a quantitative trait such as the individual warfarin dose requirement correspond to the lower and upper ends of the dose distribution histogram.

We observed genome-wide significant signals (p <= 5 x 10-8) in the well-known VKORC1 and CYP2C9 regions. Figures 2 and 3 show the regional plots for the VKORC1 and CYP2C9 regions, respectively. In the VKORC1 region, the marker showing the strongest effect was rs749671. For this SNP, the G allele was strongly associated with high warfarin dose (G allele, OR: 20.4 [14.3-29.0]; p = 1.08 x 10-33). In the CYP2C9 region, the strongest effect was observed for rs9332238.

No genome-wide significant regions were identified in this analysis, but there were several regions with suggestive signals (p < 10-5). We analyzed in more detail these regions and, based on the regional plots and the imputation scores, we identified a number of markers to follow-up in three available datasets corresponding to GWA studies in European, African-American and Japanese samples. The European and African-American GWA studies used stable warfarin dose as a quantitative trait, and did not follow the EDP approach that we used in our study. In order to make these two studies directly comparable to our Brazilian study, the European and African-American samples were classified in two categories, following the same approach used in our study: a low-dose category including individuals with stable warfarin weekly dose less than 20 mg and a high-dose category including individuals with weekly dose greater than 42.5 mg/week. A logistic regression was then used to evaluate the association of the lead SNPs with warfarin dose, conditioning on the same markers used as covariates in our study. The Japanese GWA study used a similar EDP approach to that employed in our study, classifying individuals into low and high warfarin categories. However, Japanese typically require lower warfarin dosage than individuals from other populations, and the weekly warfarin thresholds used in the Japanese study were lower than the thresholds defined in our study: 7 mg/week for the low dose category and 28 mg/week for the high-dose category.

We identified genome-wide significant associations in the VKORC1 and CYP2C9 regions. In the VKORC1 region, there were multiple markers with p-values <10-30 (Figure 2). The top signal was rs749671, with a p-value of 1.08 x 10-33 and an odds ratio estimate of 20.4 for the G allele. The SNP rs9923231, which has been associated with warfarin dose in previous studies, showed a similar p-value (p = 3.38 x 10-33).

A similar situation was reported by Takeuchi et al., who described in a European sample that their top signal in the CYP2C9 region, rs4917639, was almost perfectly associated with the 'composite' CYP2C9*2 and *3 allele. In our sample, rs9332238 (minor allele frequency 19.6%) shows a stronger association with the 'composite' of CYP2C9*2 (frequency 13.1%) and *3 (frequency 6.6%) than rs4917639 (frequency 22.2%) or rs4918798 (frequency 21.9%).", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 22064, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "In our initial analysis, aside from VKORC1 and CYP2C9, no other regions reached genome-wide significance. In previous GWA studies of warfarin dose, the application of conditional analysis including VKORC1 and CYP2C9 in the statistical models uncovered novel variants in CYP4F2 and the CYP2C cluster on chromosome 10. We carried out statistical analysis conditioning on VKORC1 rs749671, CYP2C9*2 and CYP2C9*3. We did not observe any genome-wide significant signals in this analysis (Supplementary Figures 5 & 6). Based on the regional plots and imputation scores, we selected a number of suggestive SNPs (p < 10-5) for follow-up in European and African-American samples, which were analyzed using the same EDP approach used in our study. We could not replicate any of the suggestive signals (Supplementary Table 2). The ideal approach for replication would have been to analyze the markers in another Brazilian sample, but no such sample was available to us. The results of the replication do not have a straightforward interpretation, given that the patterns of LD may differ between these populations and the Brazilian admixed groups. The lack of replication could be due to a number of factors, including: 1) the signals identified are false positives, 2) lack of statistical power, particularly considering that the effect sizes observed in our study may be inflated (winner's curse), and 3) discordant patterns of LD in samples of different ancestry. In our gene-based association tests using the GATES approach32, in addition to VKORC1 and CYP2C9, three other genes, LINC00511, NDEL1 and POU4F3, reached genome-wide significance. To our knowledge, these genes have not been associated with warfarin dose in any previous studies. We evaluated the association of the lead SNPs in these genes in the European and African-American samples, but none of the SNPs was nominally significant in these samples (data not shown). As expected, our pathway analyses using KEGG annotations identified genesets involved in the metabolism of xenobiotics, driven by genome-wide signals observed on chromosome 10, where CYP2C9 and other genes of the cytochrome P450 CYP2C cluster are located. The pathway analyses based on GO annotations also highlighted genesets involved in drug metabolism process, including VKORC1 and CYP2C9.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 24388, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "In conclusion, here we present the first GWA study of warfarin dose in the Brazilian population. In agreement with previous studies in other populations, the strongest effects on warfarin dose were observed for VKORC1 and CYP2C9. No other genome-wide significant regions were identified in the study, and we could not replicate a number of suggestive signals in European and African-American samples. This may be related to two important limitations of this study: the sample size of the discovery sample was relatively small, in spite of the fact that we used an EDP approach to maximize our power to detect significant effects, and no Brazilian samples were available for replication, therefore complicating the interpretation of the replication results. Further GWA studies or meta-analytic efforts with larger samples sizes will be necessary to identify other potential regions with smaller effects on warfarin dose in this population.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 25330, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "Future perspective", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 25349, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The complex structure of the Brazilian population, highly heterogeneous and admixed, implies that extrapolation of pharmacogenomic data from candidate gene or GWA studies in well-defined ethnic groups (e.g., European and North American Caucasians) may not be appropriate to the majority of Brazilians. This prompted the present study, which extended to Brazilians the GWAS evidence that common SNPs with large effects on warfarin dose appear to be restricted to the CYP2C9 and VKORC1 regions. One of the major strengths of this study was the availability of imputed data based on the dense 1000 Genomes reference dataset, which made it possible to evaluate in detail the effect of common variants in these regions. Based on our annotations of the top signals, several SNPs within the VKORC1 region could have putative functional effects, and it would be important to explore through functional assays or studies in animal models the specific role of these variants in warfarin dose. In CYP2C9, we identified a polymorphism, rs749671, that is virtually in perfect association with the CYP2C9*2 and *3 alleles. It would be interesting to examine the impact of including rs749671 - rather than CYP2C9*2 and *3 - as a covariate in warfarin dosing algorithms for Brazilians.
