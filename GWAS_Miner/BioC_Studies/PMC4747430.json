Moreover, p21 acts as a master effector of multiple tumour suppressor pathways which are independent of classical p53 tumour suppression. Also, by binding to PCNA, p21 interferes with PCNA-dependent DNA polymerase activity, thereby inhibiting DNA replication and modulating PCNA-dependent DNA repair. Through binding to PCNA, p21 also competes for PCNA binding with DNA polymerase-delta and several other proteins involved in DNA synthesis, thus directly inhibiting DNA synthesis. Similarly, p21 represses MYC-dependent transcription and in turn, MYC disrupts the PCNA-p21 interaction, thus alleviating p21-dependent inhibition of PCNA and DNA synthesis. Decreased p21 expression has been reported to be a feature of dysplastic aberrant crypt foci in colonic mucosa and adenomas.

We also analyzed publicly-available mRNA expression data from fibroblasts, lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCL), T-cells, adipose tissue and CRC (Supplementary Table 5).
