Epidemiological and clinical studies over the last 20 years have established its associations with risks of arterial and venous thromboembolic events as well as with other pathologies including disseminated intravascular coagulation, cancer progression, and cognitive decline. The current study confirms a previous report from a smaller study that D-dimer levels are associated with the factor V Leiden F5 R506Q variant (rs6025), which is associated with risks of arterial and venous thrombosis. Also confirmed is a previous report that D-dimer levels are also associated with the FGA Thr331Ala variant (rs6050) variant, which is also associated with risks of arterial and venous thrombosis.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 18604, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "However, the most important finding in this report is the novel association of D-dimer levels with variation upstream from F3, which produces tissue factor. While there is considerable experimental evidence that tissue factor plays an important role in initiation of hemostasis and arterial thrombosis, to date there has been very limited epidemiological evidence that tissue factor initiates activation of blood coagulation in generally healthy individuals. Our demonstration that a genetic variant upstream from F3 is associated with variation in D-dimer levels in generally healthy populations supports the concept that F3 might be a potential therapeutic target to reduce thrombotic risk. The measurement of plasma D-dimer has clinical utility when ruling-out a pulmonary embolism diagnosis in the acute phase for symptomatic patients but is otherwise a weak predictor of the risk of arterial and venous thrombotic events in healthy persons. The overall genetic contribution of the 3 loci to D-dimer variation identified in this report was modest, less than 2% of variation in the phenotype, and is unlikely to have immediate applications to clinical prediction models for arterial or venous thrombosis in the general population.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 19838, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "title_2"}, "text": "Sub-Threshold Associations", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 19865, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Among the 13 sub-threshold loci identified, 7 had high-signal markers in genes and another 3 had markers within 50kb of genes.

The meta-analysis included over 20,000 individuals of European ancestry and examined over 2.5 million markers spread throughout the genome. The novel association identified was for a variant whose p-value was over 40 orders of magnitude smaller than the significance threshold of 5.0x10-8 set as significant. Genetic associations of such strength have consistently replicated in other settings, and for this reason, we did not seek replication. With a sample-size of ~21,000, we had 80% power (2-sided alpha = 5.0x10-8) to detect a 0.067 unit difference in log D-dimer (mean = 5, standard deviation = 1) for a variant with an MAF of 0.3. Most of the sub-threshold findings had smaller differences in log D-dimer levels than the 0.067 difference. The D-dimer phenotype was measured in a standardized fashion within each cohort but measurement methods differed between cohorts and likely introduced between-group variability. This variability may decrease statistical power to find associations of smaller magnitudes. Not all SNPs tested were directly genotyped and the imputation quality varied across SNPs and cohorts. For poorly imputed SNPs, there was reduced statistical power to detect an association. For each identified locus, we chose the SNP with the smallest p-value but the causal variant:if one exists:need not be the one with the smallest p-value or may not have been measured or imputed. There was variability in the cohort-specific point estimates around the meta-analytic estimated mean effect of each SNP. This is type of variation is expected and most likely attributable to random variation in the genotype-phenotype association but may also be influenced by other unmeasured factors.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 22117, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "title_2"}, "text": "Summary", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 22125, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Using data from 13 cohorts that included 21,052 participants, we identified 3 genes associated with fibrin D-dimer levels (F3, F5, and FGA), of which the F3 association has not been previously reported.
