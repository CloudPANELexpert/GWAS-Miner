A recent meta-analysis of existing twin studies reported heritability estimates of 45% for males and 39% for females for cannabis use initiation. Not much is known about the genetic variants and biological mechanisms underlying this heritability. The few linkage studies that examined cannabis use phenotypes reported non-overlapping linkage peaks that did not meet genome-wide significance (see). Candidate gene association studies for cannabis use have mainly focussed on genes known to be involved in the endogenous cannabinoid system: the cannabinoid receptor 1 gene (CNR1) and the fatty acid amide hydrolase gene (FAAH). But again, while some nominally significant associations were reported, others were unable to replicate these (see). A recent large scale study testing for association of these two and eight other candidate genes with lifetime frequency of cannabis use did not support association with any of the genes (; NB: this study used the same Australian subsample as used in the present study). The lack of replication may point to potential publication bias and false-positive findings in candidate gene association studies and also highlights the limited understanding of the neurobiology of cannabis use.

First, we meta-analysed results from two genome-wide association analyses of initiation of cannabis use (ever versus never) in order to identify genetic variants underlying cannabis use. With a combined sample size of over 10,000 individuals (from 4,622 independent families) and a substantially higher number of cases, this study provided more power to identify genetic variants of small effect size than the study by.

It should be noted that the prevalence is substantially higher in the Australian sample. Higher levels of cannabis use have generally been reported in Australia than in the UK, but the difference may be larger due to age differences between the two samples and because a subset of the Australian sample has been ascertained for familial alcohol and nicotine use.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 4083, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Genotype data were obtained using different Illumina SNP platforms (317K, HumanCNV370-Quadv3, HumanCNV370v1, and Human610-Quad).

Subsequently, both datasets were imputed separately using MACH using reference data from the European HapMap I + II samples, (Release 22 Build 36).

We performed a total test of association which employs a linear regression method while explicitly correcting for the relatedness between family members (including MZ twins) within the variance/covariance model. The strongest associations were verified using the Generalized Disequilibrium Test (GDT,) which is specifically designed for use with dichotomous data. However, unlike Merlin-offline, which can analyse dosage data, GDT can only be used with hard-call genotypes, which are less informative than dosage data thus resulting in a less powerful test. A meta-analysis of the association results from both studies was conducted in METAL using the effect sizes of the SNPs along with their standard errors. Next, we conducted a gene-based test (VEGAS,) in order to determine if particular genes harbour an excess of associated variants. This test summarises evidence for association on a per gene basis by considering the p-value of all SNPs within the gene, while accounting for linkage disequilibrium and number of SNPs in the gene.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 6030, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Results from the meta-analysis are summarised in Figure 1 (Manhattan plot), Supplementary Figure 1 (Q-Q plot), and Supplementary Table 1 (strongest associations; note that the results were similar with Merlin-offline and GDT), and the strongest gene-based associations are shown in Supplementary Table 2. We did not identify any SNP or gene that was significantly associated with cannabis use initiation, after correcting for multiple testing. An approximate power calculation indicates the combined samples provided 65% and 98% power to detect a genetic variant (with a minor allele frequency of 0.25) with a relative risk of 1.15 and 1.2, respectively. This indicates that individual common genetic variants of this size or greater do not contribute to individual differences in initiation of cannabis use.

This estimate is obtained by correlating the genetic similarity (i.e. the identity by state at the SNP level) between individuals (relatedness < 0.025) with their phenotypic similarity. The methodology is explained in more detail in the Supplementary material. We estimated that only 6.0% (SE=10.2, p=0.28) of the variance in cannabis use initiation is due to the aggregated effect of common variants. The relatively large standard error indicates that this estimate is somewhat imprecise, mostly due to the limited power of the sample (N=4612 unrelated individuals), but also by the measurement of the phenotype (binary, as opposed to continuous) and potentially by the heterogeneity of the phenotype between the two samples.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 7919, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "This SNP-based heritability estimate is substantially lower than the heritability estimate of ~40% obtained from twin studies. The discrepancy between twin and SNP-based heritability estimates is larger than for some other phenotypes, such as height and intelligence, but similar to for example personality, where the SNP-based estimates for various personality traits are between 4 and 12%, while the twin and family-based heritability estimates are between 30 and 60%. Note that heritability estimates from twin studies include the effects of all causal genetic variants, while the heritability estimated using GCTA includes only the effects of variants that are in linkage disequilibrium with the SNPs included in the analyses. These SNPs do not capture all genetic variants, especially not rare variants or variants with low minor allele frequencies. Although the SNP-based heritability estimate is somewhat imprecise due to limited power, the result raises the possibility that the role of common genetic variants in the heritability of initiation of cannabis use is low, which could help to explain why we were unable to find any genetic association. It may also suggest that non-additive genetic effects (dominance and/or epistasis), interactions with the environment, and/or rare mutations also play a role. Alternatively, twin studies may have overestimated the relative contribution of genetic influences (see).
