Heterogeneity was tested using the Cochran's Q test and was also measured using Higgins' index. We generated genetic scores for individuals on the basis of an allelic scoring system involving our three SNPs. These scores were created either through the number of at-risk alleles for the European discovery and Japanese replication populations or the risk allele dosage in the European replication population. Risk allele dosages from the European replication population were collapsed using dosage. The distribution of imputed dosage is shown in Supplementary Figure 13a.

RVOT cardiomyocytes from Hey2+/- mice showed a significant increase in maximal upstroke velocity (dV/dTmax, a measure of sodium channel availability and a determinant of conduction velocity) and action potential amplitude (APA), indicating increased sodium channel availability (*P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; Student's t test). Resting membrane potential (RMP), action potential duration at 20% and 50% repolarization (APD20 and APD50, respectively) were not significantly different in wild-type and Hey2+/- mice; action potential duration at 90% repolarization (APD90) was significantly increased in RVOT cardiomyocytes from Hey2+/- mice.
