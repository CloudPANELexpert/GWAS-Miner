Larger sample sizes and thorough examination of these loci will be required to delineate their effects in African Americans. A recent GWAS on anthropometric traits has been conducted in two populations of Africans and African Americans. Nominal association was observed at rs8077681 in SLC39A11 in the African-American GWAS samples (P = 0.0011) but this SNP was not replicated in additional samples. In our GWAS, we observed nominal association (P = 0.0001) in a nearby SNP rs9893303 but showed no replication (P = 0.11) (Supplementary Table S2 online). rs8077681 and rs9893303 were not in linkage disequilibrium (D' = 0, r2 = 0) in our African American samples. This locus may warrant further investigation.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 23221, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The combined sample of 4,989 subjects in this report had reasonable power to detect modest effect sizes at alpha level of 1 x 10-4, the threshold used for follow-up replication.

In order to increase sample size and study power, we used both community nondiabetic and diabetic subjects with or without nephropathy for gene discovery and replication. Since obesity is a risk factor for diabetes, it is unclear if the presence of diabetes would affect the genetic effect on adiposity measures. T2DM-ESRD subjects in the GWAS may impact nutritional parameters. Indeed, some of the prior GWAS on adiposity also included patients with metabolic disease (e.g., T2DM, coronary artery disease, hypertension) as part of the gene discovery cohorts to increase study power and did not show strong heterogeneity of effect size between the healthy subjects and affected patients. In the present study, we selected SNPs for follow-up based on the presence of GWAS association in both nondiabetic and T2DM-ESRD subjects. The overall association signals were comparable in these two groups as shown by the similar observed vs. expected distribution of heterogeneity P values in the respective quantile-quantile plot (Supplementary Figure S3 online). The effect sizes of the five most associated SNPs were also not significantly different among the nondiabetic, T2DM-ESRD, and T2DM groups (Table 3). This suggests that the presence of disease had minimal effect, if any, on the genetic associations of the top signals although cautious interpretation is needed.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 25271, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "In conclusion, we identified four putative BMI loci at PP13439-TMEM212, CDH12, MFAP3-GALNT10, and FER1L4 that demonstrated consistent association in six African-American GWAS and replication cohorts.

Given the differences in environment, body composition, and genetic backgrounds among different ethnic groups, additional studies and meta-analyses in African Americans and comparison of results to other ethnic groups is necessary to shed light on whether allelic and locus heterogeneity have a significant contribution to the genetics of adiposity in various ethnic groups.", "sentences": [],
