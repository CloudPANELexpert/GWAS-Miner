The top intragenic SNPs in the ASN GWAS of paclitaxel-induced cytotoxicity were located near AIPL1 gene. Upon knockdown of AIPL1 in human induced pluripotent stem cell derived neurons, decreased sensitivity to paclitaxel as measured by neurite outgrowth phenotypes. Using a gene based approach, a gene identified as Asian specific (overlapped in Asian LCLs and Asian clinical cohort of neuropathy) BCR (breakpoint cluster region), was validated using iPSC-derived neurons with knockdown corresponding to increased sensitivity to paclitaxel induced damage to neurons. The same approach identified PTPMT1 associated with paclitaxel-induced cytotoxicity in Asian LCLs, as well as Asian and European paclitaxel induced peripheral neuropathy clinical cohorts.

The samples also have gene expression, miRNA, modified cytosine and protein data that allow for the elucidation of potential function of the genetic variants associated with pharmacologic phenotypes. Our observation of a lack of population difference in paclitaxel-induced cytotoxicity is in contrast to population differences observed for platinating agents, and antimetabolites. In part, these population differences in drug sensitivity may be explained by population differences in gene expression. The role of gene expression in population differences in chemotherapeutic cytotoxicity is supported by the observation that pharmacologic SNPs for several different chemotherapeutic agents (etoposide, daunorubicin, cisplatin, carboplatin, cytarabine, capecitabine) are enriched in eQTLs or SNPs associated with gene expression. In contrast, pharmacologic SNPs associated with paclitaxel are not enriched in eQTLs; however enrichment in protein quantitative trait loci has been observed. These differences may be due to differences in mechanism of action of paclitaxel, a microtubule stabilizer compared to the other cytotoxic agents that target DNA.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 25949, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "In our Asian patient dataset, it appears that peripheral neuropathy is more common in females than males (males: 1 case/33 controls; females: 23 cases/88 controls); however, this gender difference is likely confounded by differences in cumulative dose, treatment schedule or age of the patients.

We employed Sherlock to compare genes significant in two patient studies of paclitaxel induced neuropathy (855 European and 183 Japanese) and the LCL data we generated in the Asian populations. According to the gene-based test, 10 genes including PTPMT1 were found to overlap between Asians and Europeans along with hundreds of candidate gene associations that were unique to each population. At this threshold, PTPMT1 was revealed as a common target of paclitaxel-induced sensory peripheral neuropathy among populations. PTPMT1 is anchored in the inner mitochondrial membrane and is required for mitochondrial integrity and oxidative respiration. Because its ablation increased apoptosis in cancer cell lines and decreased differentiation and proliferation, but not survival in embryonic stem cells, its function may be cell-type specific in the regulation of cell growth and survival. Thus PTPMT1 in peripheral nerve mitochondria may play a critical role in paclitaxel-induced neurotoxicity across populations and is worth further studies.

In evaluating SNPs within or close to AIPL1, rs7214517 was associated with Asian patient peripheral neuropathy (p = 0.028). AIPL1 expressed in rod and cone photoreceptors has a critical role in cell viability, and gene defects in AIPL1 cause heterogeneous degenerations of the human retina, such as retinitis pigmentosa. Interestingly, this disease is related to NARP syndrome (neuropathy, ataxia and retinitis pigmentosa) which is an inherited condition chiefly affecting nervous systems due to mitochondrial DNA dysfunction in creating adenosine triphosphate. Its worldwide prevalence is unknown and it remains unclear how this disruption in mitochondrial energy production leads to muscle weakness, vision loss and the other specific features of NARP syndrome. Kirschman et al. also found that transgenic expression of AIPL1 restored rod morphology and the rod-derived electroretinogram response in Aipl-/- mice, implicating a neuron component for this gene. Mitochondrial dysfunction has been implicated as a mechanism for neurotoxicity of paclitaxel and our results demonstrated that decreased expression of AIPL1 significantly decreased sensitivity of neurons to paclitaxel, hence, there could be a cell-type specific function of AIPL1 in a mitochondrial component in peripheral neurons and AIPL1 could be a potential therapeutic target of paclitaxel-induced sensory peripheral neuropathy especially in Asians.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 29574, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "We identified a set of 32 Asian specific genes that overlapped in the Asian LCL and Asian patient datasets.

Furthermore, Huntington's-associated protein, 1A interacts with Bcr on microtubules to regulate neuronal differentiation.

However, there are some considerable issues in clinical GWAS of CIPN including: 1) lack of replication studies; 2) pharmacogenomics underlying ethnic specificity and; 3) lack of appropriate models to functionally validate important GWAS results. Therefore, combining cell-based data with multiple clinical genome wide association studies, as done in this study, is a way to identify the most promising genes.
