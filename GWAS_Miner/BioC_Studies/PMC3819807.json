We hypothesized that the reduced genetic variability in combination with increased homozygosity would facilitate identification of genetic variants that contribute to the high rate of AD in this community. AD cases (N=124) and controls (N=142) from Wadi Ara were genotyped for a a genome-wide set of more than 300,000 single nucleotides polymorphisms (SNPs) which were used to calculate measures of population stratification and inbreeding, and to identify regions of autozygosity. Although a high degree of relatedness was evident in both cases and controls, controls were significantly more related and contained more autozygous regions than cases (P = 0.004). Eight autozygous regions on seven different chromosomes were more frequent in controls than cases, and 105 SNPs in these regions, primarily on chromosomes 6 and 9, were nominally associated with AD. Associations with SNPs in NOTCH4 and AGPAT1 (both on chromosome 6) were confirmed in a meta analysis of four genome-wide association study (GWAS) datasets. Analysis of the full Wadi Ara GWAS dataset revealed 99 SNP associations with AD at P <= 10-5, however none of these were confirmed in the replication GWAS datasets.

Several genome-wide association studies have been conducted to identify genes and chromosomal regions that contribute to disease risk, with varying results. To date, only four genes have been identified with robust, replicable, and large effects on AD risk:mutations in the amyloid precursor protein (APP) and presenilin 1 and 2 (PSEN1, PSEN2) cause rare, early-onset Mendelian forms of the disease, while the epsilon4 variant of apolipoprotein E (APOE) is the primary genetic susceptibility factor for the more common late onset form of the disease. The primary challenge in identifying genes associated with late onset AD, as demonstrated by recent studies is that 50% or more of the genetic variance of AD risk is not yet accounted for, and likely is due to the effects of multiple loci individually contributing modestly to AD risk.

Our initial genetic studies of AD in this community were prompted by the unusually high prevalence of AD (20.5% in those >= with age 60 yr, 60.5% in those with age >= 85 yr), despite having a lower frequency of the APOE epsilon4 alleles than other Caucasian populations.

We then tested the presence or absence of these homozygous regions, as well as the individual SNPs within these regions for association with AD using logistic regression adjusting for sex and age at ascertainment. In addition to the genotyped SNPs, we imputed genotypes for 2.54 million SNPs using the Markov Chain haplotyping (MaCH) software (http://www.sph.umich.edu/csg/abecasis/MACH/). Unrelated individuals from the CEPH Utah pedigrees (CEU) in the HapMap consortium were used as a reference haplotype set. We observed a drop in imputation accuracy when we used a mixture of CEU (Caucasians) and Yoruban YRI (Africans) populations as reference haplotypes. The entire SNP set was subsequently analyzed using age- and sex-adjusted logistic regression models. The presence or absence of a homozygous region was modeled as a binary variable, and SNPs were modeled assuming an additive effect of the minor allele dose.

AGPAT1 is an endoplasmic reticulum transmembrane protein which catalyzes the conversion of lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) to phosphatidic acid, both of which are involved in cellular signal transduction and in lipid biosynthesis. LPA increases Tau phosphorylation (a commonly observed characteristic in AD brains) during LPA-induced neurite retraction. NOTCH4 is a member of a gene family which is involved in a variety of developmental processes by controlling cell fate decisions. Intramembrane proteolysis of NOTCH4 is regulated by gamma-secretase, whose activity is responsible for the final cleavage of the APP releasing Abeta peptide. Several studies have evaluated association of AD with NOTCH4, but the results were equivocal because the sample sizes were small and only a few SNPs in this 33 kb gene were tested. SNPs in TNXB have shown evidence for association with schizophrenia in Japanese and UK populations, although the association was not observed in a Chinese cohort.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 27129, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Although none of the associations were replicated in the meta-analysis, several functional candidates were identified through the GWAS approach. The relationship between impaired proteasome function and AD makes PSMF1 an attractive candidate gene by impacting disease risk through the intracellular protein degradation pathway. Localized at the nuclear envelope/endoplasmic reticulum membrane, PSMF1 does not inhibit cellular proteasome activity, but instead interferes with the maturation of immunoproteasome precursor complexes. Although the function of CPN8, the gene with the strongest SNP associations in Wadi Ara, has not been well characterized, CPN1 promotes calcium-dependent aggregation of lipid vesicles. The FIG4 gene product forms a regulatory complex with VAC14, controlling the synthesis of phosphatidylinositol 3,5-bisphosphate. Loss of VAC14 function caused neurodegeneration in mice, and certain mutations in FIG4 cause neurodegeneration in humans. ASTN2 was identified by its similarity to ASTN1, a neuronal adhesion molecule that mediates the migration of young postmitotic neuroblasts in cortical regions of developing brain. The associations with SNPs in these genes are mostly speculative given the lack of association in the meta-analysis datasets.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 28402, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Finally, the lack of significant association results for the small number of SNPs typed in the genes surrounding APOE (TOMM40 and PVRL2) are consistent with those regions having a regulatory function on APOE. If these variants in these genes alter the expression levels of non-risk alleles of APOE, the overall disease risk would be unlikely to change. Alternately, the low SNP density or weak linkage disequilibrium (LD) in the region might have prevented us from observing effects of TOMM40 and/or PVRL2. Lastly, APOE might be the true causal variant and the observed effects of SNPs in TOMM40 and PVRL2 might be due the LD with APOE.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 29039, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Several caveats limit the interpretation of the results in this study. First, the Wadi Ara sample is relatively small compared to other published AD GWAS, a fact reflected in the modest P-values. The size of this sample prohibits detection of genome wide significant associations with variants with small effects, i.e., odds ratios less than 1.2 that were observed in two GWAS each containing more than 10,000 subjects. By comparison, we had 80% power to detect an odds ratio above 3.5 at P <= 5 x 10-8 for a SNP with a MAF of 10%. However, our strategy of replicating the top-ranked SNPs from the autozygosity mapping and genome wide approaches in several larger GWAS datasets identified several genes and regions which can be further interrogated in even larger datasets assembled by consortia in the US, Europe and Asia. Second, the lack of data on potential environmental risk factors for AD limited our ability to determine conclusively the cause(s) of the high disease rate in Wadi Ara. Despite these limitations, this work exemplifies the advantages of isolated populations in genetic association studies and shows homozygosity mapping to be a useful analytic tool in studies of these populations.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 30248, "infons": {"section_type": "SUPPL", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "Supplementary Material", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 30271, "infons": {"section_type": "REF", "type": "title"}, "text": "References", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 30282, "infons": {"fpage": "44", "name_0": "surname:Abraham;given-names:R", "name_1": "surname:Moskvina;given-names:V", "name_10": "surname:Williams;given-names:J", "name_11": "surname:Owen;given-names:MJ", "name_12": "surname:Kirov;given-names:G", "name_2": "surname:Sims;given-names:R", "name_3": "surname:Hollingworth;given-names:P", "name_4": "surname:Morgan;given-names:A", "name_5": "surname:Georgieva;given-names:L", "name_6": "surname:Dowzell;given-names:K", "name_7": "surname:Cichon;given-names:S", "name_8": "surname:Hillmer;given-names:AM", "name_9": "surname:O'Donovan;given-names:MC", "pub-id_pmid": "18823527", "section_type": "REF", "source": "BMC Med.
