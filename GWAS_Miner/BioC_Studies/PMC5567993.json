The 15q25 locus spanned several other genes, including NMB, for which there were multiple significant eQTLs in European American left atrial samples (Table S13), and rs11073730 was also a significant eQTL for several genes in various tissues in GTEx, including ALPK3 (Table S9). In addition, two perfect proxies were associated with increased expression of CSPG4P11 in tissue from the tibial nerve (p=1.4x10-6 and 2.2x10-6) and rs11073730, along with 14 proxies in strong LD (r2 = 0.8-1, was associated with increased expression of WDR73 in the muscular layer of the esophagus (p=3.3x10-7-1.4x10-9).

P-wave duration reflects the depolarization of both right and left atrium, while P-wave terminal force, which is calculated from the last half portion of the P-wave, more specifically represents left atrial activation. Soliman et al. have shown that the mutual PWI correlations are weak to moderate in a study of more than 15,000 individuals. In particular, P-wave duration and P-wave terminal force displayed the weakest correlation (Pearson's R 0.08-0.29). In this study, we found that the genetically determined P-wave duration is highly associated with the measured P-wave terminal force and vice versa, but that the percentage of explained variance between the two PWI was small. Thus, we had expected to identify genetic loci uniquely associated with either right or left atrial activation, in addition to some overlap of genetic variants associated with both phenotypes in the present study. We did discover one genetic locus associated with both P-wave duration and P-wave terminal force, encompassing the gene MYH6. The 14q11 locus includes MYH6, the gene encoding myosin heavy chain 6 protein, which is important in actin and calmodulin binding in the sarcomere of striated muscles. The most significant variant at this locus, rs452036, and its proxy rs365990 (CEU r2=0.96) have been associated with heart rate in multiple GWAS and most likely represent the same locus. MYH6 has been implicated in congenital heart defects, dilated and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, AF, atrial septal defects, and sick sinus syndrome.

Indeed, some of the genes identified in the analyses of P-wave duration are more likely to produce \"electrical\" disturbances (SCN5A, SCN10A, HCN1, CAV1/CAV2, EPAS1, CAND2, and CAMK2D), while a selection of the genes identified in the analyses of P-wave terminal force are more likely to cause \"structural\" changes (TBX5, ALPK3/NMB, MYH6, and SPON1). However, recent studies have reported that P-wave terminal force was not associated with left atrial enlargement on echocardiography or computed tomography volume measurement. In a sample of 275 middle-aged Americans referred to cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging between 2001-2004, electrocardiographic P-wave terminal force (negative P terminal force in V1 > 0.04 s x mm) had high specificity (88%), but low sensitivity (37%) and positive predictive value (47%) for left atrial enlargement, compared to volumetric assessment of left atrial size.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 27338, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "title_2"}, "text": "Strengths and limitations", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 27364, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Strengths of our study include the substantial power obtained by including more than 44,000 individuals from established studies with carefully phenotyped participants.

Second, one could consider adjusting the P value for significant results for the two traits considered (5x10-8/2 = 2.5x10-8); however, the P-wave duration and P-wave terminal force are only weakly correlated so we used a conventional threshold for genome wide significance of 5x10-8. Third, associations with p-values in the range of 1x10-8 to 10-10 will require replication in independent cohorts. Fourth, although we included individuals of both European and African ancestry, our findings may not be generalizable to other ancestries. Fifth, the analyses in African Americans were underpowered compared with our analyses in European-ancestry individuals and require replication as other studies become available in the future. Last, it is important to remember that we have identified markers of genetic regions involved in the P-wave indices. The genes outlined above are the genes closest to the most significant variant in each genetic region, yet it remains unclear whether they truly are the effector genes.

Since measures of atrial activation have been associated with left atrial enlargement and/or atrial fibrillation, we sought to determine the genetic basis of P-wave duration and P-wave terminal force. We identified six new genetic loci that contribute to the maximum P-wave duration and six genetic loci that contribute to the P-wave terminal force. When integrating our results with prior work, we have identified a genetic architecture of the P wave in which some genetic loci are uniquely associated with distinct electrocardiographic parameters and others are more broadly associated with atrial conduction. Further studies evaluating the function of the genetic loci linked to atrial conduction may help elucidate the biology underlying atrial conduction, as well as provide new targets for anti-arrhythmic drugs.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}], "annotations": [], "relations": []}]}
