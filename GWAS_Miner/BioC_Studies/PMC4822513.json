A better understanding of the genetic factors regulating homocysteine levels, particularly in non-white populations, may help in risk stratification analyses of existing clinical trials and may point to novel targets for homocysteine-lowering therapy. To identify genetic influences on plasma homocysteine levels in individuals with African ancestry, we performed a targeted gene and pathway-based analysis using a priori biological information and then to identify new association performed a genome-wide association study. All analyses used combined data from the African American and Yoruba cohorts from the Indianapolis-Ibadan Dementia Project.

It exists at a critical biochemical juncture between methionine metabolism and the biosynthesis of the amino acids cysteine and taurine. HCY (Fig. 1) is normally metabolized via two biochemical pathways: re-methylation, which converts homocysteine back to methionine, and trans-sulfuration, which converts homocysteine to cysteine and taurine. Abnormally high blood levels of HCY signal a breakdown in this biochemical process, resulting in far-reaching biochemical and life consequences such as increased cardiovascular risks and cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Increased HCY levels have been associated with cerebral atrophy and cognitive impairment. Meta-analyses have demonstrated a positive association between increased HCY levels and dementia risk and cognitive function in AD patients although the results have been inconsistent. Recent metabolomics studies have revealed that methionine and the pathway leading to cysteine and glutathione production may be dysregulated in AD patients suggesting aberrant methylation processes that can contribute to disease pathogenesis (see the study by Fuso and Scarpa for short review).
