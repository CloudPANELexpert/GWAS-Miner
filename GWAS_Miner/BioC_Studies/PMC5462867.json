As indicated by family, twin and adoption studies, genetic factors mediate part of vulnerability to major depressive disorder (MDD) with a modest heritability of around 40%. However, we understand little of the specific genetic architecture of MDD. Multiple genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for MDD have been published. The largest MDD GWAS was the mega-analysis by the MDD Working Group of the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (PGC). In that study, over 9,000 MDD cases and 9,500 controls were analyzed but no association with MDD reached genome wide significance. Recently, CONVERGE (China, Oxford and VCU Experimental Research on Genetic Epidemiology) consortium identified two genome-wide significant associations in 5,303 Chinese women with severe and recurrent MDD (near the SIRT1 gene, P=2.53x10-10 and in an intron of the LHPP gene, P=6.45x10-12). A GWAS of depressive symptoms (heritability 23%-29%) in the Cohorts for Heart and Aging Research in Genomic Epidemiology (CHARGE) consortium in approximately 50,000 people from the general population found no genome-wide significant associations.

Using a continuum approach may augment statistical power as sample size can be increased substantially and patients who fall into the 'grey area' can be assessed. Several lines of evidence support a depression continuum. In longitudinal studies, there is an increased risk of MDD in patients with minor depression and subthreshold depression. Statistical studies of disorder classification (taxometric) suggested that severity of depression is continuously distributed and there is no discontinuity in the latent structure of depression. Family studies report that relatives of probands with milder forms of depression have greater risk of MDD compared to relatives of probands without any mood disorders. A higher number of depressive symptoms is related to greater disability, worse quality of life, and a higher mortality risk.

First, we evaluated depression continuum by combining cases from clinical populations diagnosed with MDD and participants from the general population who had been assessed for depressive symptoms. Such an inclusive approach may increase heterogeneity of the phenotype especially because lifetime MDD was evaluated whereas depressive symptoms indicate past weeks only. If anything, such approach would cause an underestimation of the effects as less information on depressive symptoms were obtained. However, the advantages of a large sample can outweigh the disadvantages of a less precisely defined phenotype. This has been observed in the GWAS of educational attainment which was successfully used as a proxy for intelligence. Our additional replication analysis showed that increasing the sample size yielded a stronger association of the top hit with depression continuum. It is complex to calculate statistical power of the current analysis as quantitative and qualitative measures were combined. In the current study, a genetic association with the depression continuum may reflect an effect on broad depressive phenotypes but could also be accounted for by an association with low levels of general well-being (12-18% heritability) that co-occur with depressive symptoms. Second, we used a P-value based meta-analysis, as effect estimates could not be directly evaluated in a straightforward manner.
