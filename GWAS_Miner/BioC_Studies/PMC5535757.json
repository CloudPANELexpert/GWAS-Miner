In fact, beta-carotene supplementation has been associated with an increase in mortality among smokers, although it should be noted that a high daily dose of synthetic beta-carotene was utilized in this study. The discrepancy between observational and clinical studies may be due in part to genetic differences in how circulating carotenoid concentrations and their physiological effects respond to carotenoid intake. Alpha-carotene has not been studied as extensively as beta-carotene, but it is believed to have numerous beneficial health effects. Alpha-carotene is a potent antioxidant that prevents lipid oxidation, scavenges free radicals, and enhances gap junction communication. In-vivo studies suggest the ability of alpha-carotene to inhibit proliferation of cancer cells is approximately 10 times more potent than beta-carotene. In addition, alpha-carotene has been associated in observational and animal studies with a decreased risk for gastric cancers, liver and lung cancers, and other chronic diseases, including diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and chronic lower respiratory diseases. Due in part to its antioxidant properties, low levels of alpha-carotene have also been associated with diseases that are worsened by excessive oxidative stress, such as glaucoma and atrophic gastritis. Furthermore, data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys revealed an inverse association between serum alpha-carotene concentrations and the risk of all-cause mortality as well as mortality from cardiovascular disease, cancer, and all other causes not related to cardiovascular disease or cancer.
