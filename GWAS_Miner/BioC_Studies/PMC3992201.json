DISC1 was originally identified as a schizophrenia risk gene in a cytogenetic study and considerable evidence since has tied it to cognitive phenotypes in human and animal models. We observed nominally significant associations with DISC1 in both EAs and AAs (meta p=5.2x10-6). Subsequent to this common-variant association finding, we used deep sequencing at this locus to identify a set of rare variants in DISC1 that contribute to risk for OD. Thus, this study ties OD to other cognitive phenotypes via a common gene, and, as schizophrenia was one of the five disorders identified as associated to calcium pathways, also through gene pathways. Previously, we reported that another schizophrenia-associated locus, NRG1, is associated with cannabis dependence in AAs.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 24555, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Strengths of this study are a relatively large sample size, including SAGE data to increase power. All subjects were assessed using comprehensive, standardized instruments. Our primary sample has unusually good representation of AA subjects. Most of the strongest findings emerged from this understudied population; some of these were supported by findings from the EAs. We employed several novel analytic strategies, including models defining OD symptoms as a quantitative trait adjusted for addiction to other substances. Such approaches minimize concern about the misclassification of controls because SD requires exposure to the drug. An overall picture emerges of genes and pathways involved in regulating calcium and potassium signaling as major contributors to OD risk.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 25332, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Our study has several limitations. The GWS and other top-ranked findings were identified with imputed SNPs; however, empirically, our results show that the top-ranked SNPs in our study were imputed with excellent quality. Although our strongest results were with imputed SNPs, they are not rare. (Two had MAF=0.08; two, 0.06; and one, 0.03.) The primary concern about rare (MAF<1%) SNPs is the greater rate of false positive results possible due to large effect sizes (i.e., greatly increased risk) derived from small allele frequency differences between cases and controls or genotyping errors. However, studies examining this issue have concluded that nominally significant results occur less frequently than expected, even for low MAF SNPs, provided there is no genotyping or imputation quality bias between cases and controls. Moreover, the concern about false positives is substantially less when the results are replicated or supported by evidence from multiple samples, which is the case for the associations that we reported. Also, although our sample size is reasonable, experience has shown that many true associations are detected only in samples or meta-analyses that are much larger. The relatively small size of the sample used in Phase 3 for the primary trait analyses and as replication for the OD subtype findings is in our view the most likely cause of few replication observations in that sample. Specifically, there were proportionally fewer AAs available for Phase 3 (n= 805, ~24% as large as the discovery sample), which is the part of the sample in which most positive results were initially observed. Ideally, the replication sample would be larger than the discovery sample. It is also noteworthy that there was little evidence of association in EAs for any of our top findings in AAs, however, all but one of the SNPs reported in Table 1 were monomorphic in EAs. Finally, our findings are not adjusted for testing association in two populations and with two trait models (case-control and ordinal). Bonferroni correction is too conservative given the high correlation between the traits and distinct hypotheses for EAs and AAs, populations that often have distinctive risk loci and/or distinctive risk alleles at the same locus. Future studies in large independent populations are necessary to address some of these concerns.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 27684, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "In conclusion, we identified numerous novel GWS associations with OD.
