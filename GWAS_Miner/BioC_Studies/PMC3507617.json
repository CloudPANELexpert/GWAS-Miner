Fasting glucose was regressed on SNP dosage data in each ethnic group adjusting for age, gender, MESA study center, and ethnic-specific principal components. SNPs from the three gene regions with the strongest associations to fasting glucose in previous Caucasian GWAS (MTNR1B / GCK / G6PC2) were examined in depth. There was limited power to replicate associations in other ethnic groups due to smaller allele frequencies and limited sample size; SNP associations may also have differed across ethnic groups due to differing LD patterns with causal variants. rs10830963 in MTNR1B and rs4607517 in GCK demonstrated consistent magnitude and direction of association with fasting glucose across ethnic groups, although the associations were often not nominally significant.

No SNPs achieved genome-wide significance (p < 5 x 10-8) for association with fasting glucose in any of the four ethnic groups. This result was not unexpected, given the relatively small sample sizes (for GWAS analysis) in each ethnic group. We then chose to examine regions surrounding index SNPs with the top three largest effect sizes identified in the Dupuis et al. GWAS meta-analysis of fasting glucose (rs10830963 for MTNR1B, rs4607517 for G6PC2, rs560887 for GCK). We selected these regions because we determined we had at least 80% power to detect an association between the index SNP and fasting glucose (given an alpha of .05) in the Caucasian sample in MESA. We felt that, in order to examine the consistency of association across ethnic groups in depth, we needed to be powered to detect a nominal p < .05 association in Caucasians, the group in which the index SNPs were originally identified. The Dupuis et al. meta-analysis which detected signals for fasting glucose and fasting insulin included over 100,000 people while the MESA Caucasian cohort included only about 2300 individuals. Therefore, for a p-value threshold of p <.05 (and given the effect sizes reported in the Dupuis paper), we had less than 50% power to detect to detect an association with fasting glucose or fasting insulin for any of the other reported index SNPs in the MESA Caucasian sample.

SNP rs10830963 in MTNR1B demonstrated a relatively similar magnitude of association (consistent with the magnitude and direction observed in the Dupuis et al.

We thought, given our low power in non-Caucasian MESA ethnic groups, and the consistent measurement of glucose across the four ethnicities in MESA, SNPs that were detected repeatedly across ethnic groups using these two parameters might provide interesting information to aid in the search for causal variants in the region. In fact, two of the four SNPs we identified this way were previously highlighted in the literature. SNP rs1799884 in GCK, was previously hypothesized to be a SNP causally related to fasting glucose based on high sequence homology, a promoter location, and a comprehensive tag SNP study. When we meta-analyzed this SNP across the four ethnic groups in MESA, the p-value for the association of the SNP with fasting glucose was 1.3 E -6. SNP rs3821117 was one of the SNPs in the G6PC2 region most significantly associated with plasma glucose in a Caucasian GWAS of fasting glucose published by Bouatia-Naji et al., and remained associated at the level of p = .05 when the association was adjusted for SNP rs560887, the SNP most significantly associated with fasting glucose in the region in the Bouatia-Naji GWAS. According to the, SNP rs3821117 is in high LD with SNP rs2232328 in Caucasian, Asian, and Hispanic populations (although not, interestingly, in African Americans) (r2 for CEPH = 1.0, r2 for MEX = .923, r2 for JPT/CHB = 1.0, r2 for AFA = .24). SNP rs2232328 is a missense SNP in G6PC2, encoding the Ser342Cys amino acid change, and was the SNP most significantly (p = .06) associated with fasting glucose in our G6PC2 region in African Americans. However, this SNP itself was not associated at the p< .05 level with fasting glucose in any of the four MESA ethnic sub-groups and neither SNP rs3821117 or rs2232328 was even nominally associated (p < .05) with fasting glucose in the meta-analysis of all four groups in MESA.
