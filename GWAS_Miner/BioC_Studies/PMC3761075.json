Of particular interest is the lack of association of SNPs within TCF7L2, the gene with the strongest associations with type 2 diabetes observed in Europeans. While the allele frequency of the variant most strongly associated in Europeans is lower in Asian populations, estimates of the odds ratios were quite similar. In contrast, the frequency of the risk allele is similar in Mexican-Americans and Europeans, but the odds ratios are lower in both the Mexican-American and Mexico City datasets; in a fixed effects meta-analysis of SNP rs7903146 in our data and that of Voight et al., the heterogeneity p value is 0.05. Our confidence intervals for rs7903146 also overlap, but just barely, according to DIAGRAM estimates.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 24505, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The winner's curse, the tendency of a biased overestimate of effect in the first study to report an association and be successfully published, may explain the somewhat higher overestimates of effect in the top signals in the Starr County and Mexico City studies. In addition, ascertainment can contribute to these effects. For example, in Starr County, patients from families with two or more affected members were specifically targeted for the GWAS, which improves power, but leads to estimates of effect size that are larger than would be estimated in an unselected case series. In general, however, lack of replication is likely to be due to the fact that all studies of type 2 diabetes to date are under-powered to detect small effects, and therefore only detect association signals from some (probably different) subset of the contributing variants.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 25362, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type":
