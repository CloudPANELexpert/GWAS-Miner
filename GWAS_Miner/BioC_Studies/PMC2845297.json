Other studies showed that histone acetylation might influence the transcriptional regulation of the ADIPOQ gene and that pioglitazone increases plasma adiponectin by posttranscriptional regulation. Finally, an extensive bioinformatic analysis revealed that the ADIPOQ region might be a highly copy number variable region.

This candidate gene-based analysis did not yield any convincing associations with plasma adiponectin. This was surprising due to the strong link between plasma adiponectin and the metabolic syndrome or any of its components, but in-line with previous reports on a lack of association of the ADIPOQ SNPs with metabolic syndrome parameters. Whether plasma adiponectin affects metabolic syndrome parameters or metabolic syndrome parameters modulate adiponectin is highly debated as illustrated in Supplementary Figure S2. If the association of any of these 73 SNPs had been very strong with adiponectin - stronger than with the metabolic syndrome parameters - this would have pointed towards a gene locus primarily affecting plasma adiponectin and consecutively modulating the metabolic syndrome parameters. This is not suggested by our data (panel A of Supplementary Figure S2). Our data on these 73 metabolic syndrome SNPs lacks association with adiponectin beyond that expected by chance. This would rather support the idea that genetic pathways for plasma adiponectin are different from the pathways depicted by these 73 loci (panel B), or, alternatively, that pathways depicted by these 73 loci affect plasma adiponectin via the metabolic syndrome parameter and the lack of association was due to loss of power for a parameter further down the road (panel C).

The GWA approach yielded no genome-wide significant difference between men and women for any SNP, not even the ADIPOQ locus. In fact, none of the variants studied in the replication or in our candidate gene approach based on metabolic syndrome loci showed a significant sex difference. Therefore, the sex-difference in plasma adiponectin might rather be explained by sex hormones or sex-specific epigenetic programming that could be transmitted to subsequent generations in a sex-specific manner leading to transgenerational effects as recently suggested.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 21693, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The heritability estimates of plasma adiponectin are high with roughly 50-60%.

This is also in-line with 6.6% of the heritability accounted for by this locus in our family-based MICROS Study. While the ADIPOQ locus association with plasma adiponectin is thus among the strongest associations for quantitative phenotypes in genetic epidemiology, it explains only a small proportion of the overall heritability, a puzzle observed for many other phenotypes (e.g. lipids or obesity measures). Potential explanations of this gap between explained and estimated heritability are unknown rare variants with strong effects on adiponectin, unknown common loci influencing adiponectin with small effects, or deflation of association estimates due to heterogeneity between studies, uncertainties in the genotypes from imputation or uncertainties in the phenotype assessment. Our study suggests that these other genetic variants influencing plasma adiponectin are variants that explain less than 1% of the phenotypic variance.

Furthermore, our top hit in the ADIPOQ locus had limited imputation quality in two of the included GWA studies, which can be explained by the fact that KORA used a different SNP-panel (Affymetrix 500K chip) for GWAs genotyping than ERF and MICROS (Illumina HumanHap300). For most of the other SNPs followed in replication samples, the imputation quality was quite high. The relatively low imputation quality of our top-hit in two of the studies explains the lower (but still genome-wide significant) p-values in these two studies compared to KORA. This is entirely in-line with measurement error theory: a \"measurement error\" (like the uncertainty induced by the imputation) that does not depend on the phenotype (as the case here assuming that genotyping does not depend on adiponectin in the plasma) is expected to attenuate the precision of an underlying association yielding larger p-values. Therefore, the association in ERF and MICROS was rather underestimated than false positive.
