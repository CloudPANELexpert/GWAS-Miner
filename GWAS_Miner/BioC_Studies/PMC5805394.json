Three major factors might have contributed to this low number of causative mutations. First, dementia with Lewy bodies, often a disease of old age, is not commonly seen in multiplex kindreds, meaning that successful linkage studies have been rare. Second, the accurate clinical diagnosis of dementia with Lewy bodies is complex, with a high rate of misdiagnosis. Third, even the largest cohorts of dementia with Lewy body samples have been generally small, in many instances including as few as 100 patients. However, the fact that dementia with Lewy bodies has a strong genetic component is currently indisputable. The epsilon4 allele of APOE is recognised to be a strong risk factor, as are heterozygous mutations and common polymorphisms in the glucocerebrosidase gene (GBA). Both of these results have stemmed from candidate gene association studies; APOE was known to be strongly associated with Alzheimer's disease and GBA was known to be a strong risk factor for Parkinson's disease and Lewy body disorders.

Results from our conditioned analysis confirmed the different association profile between dementia with Lewy bodies and Parkinson's disease that we had previously reported. SNCA is the most significant common genetic risk factor for Parkinson's disease, with rs356182 having a meta-analysis p value of 1 85 x 10-82 (OR 1 34, 1 30-1 38) in PDGene. This variant is located 3' to the gene, whereas in dementia with Lewy bodies, no association was found in that region (figure 2). The most associated dementia with Lewy bodies SNP for the SNCA locus (rs7681440) has a Parkinson's disease meta-analysis p value of more than 0 05 in PDGene. When doing a conditional analysis on the top Parkinson's disease SNP (rs356182), Nalls and colleagues reported an independent association at the 5' region of the gene (rs7681154), and this variant is in strong linkage disequilibrium (R2=0 91) with the rs7681440 SNCA variant identified in our study. It is tempting to speculate that these differences might reflect pathobiological differences between the two diseases, perhaps mediated by differential regulation of gene expression. The results in the GTEx data, showing that the most associated SNP in dementia with Lewy bodies is a strong eQTL in the cerebellum for RP11-67M1.1, are compatible with a model in which rs7681440 genotypes affect the expression levels of SNCA indirectly through the action of RP11-67M1.1. More specifically, the alternative allele associates with a decreased expression of RP11-67M1.1 and consequently reduced repression of SNCA transcription (increased SNCA expression), which is in accordance with an increased frequency of the alternative allele in participants with dementia with Lewy bodies when compared with controls. Additionally, the relationship between rs7681154 and SNCA expression is supported by the high expression of SNCA in the brain and the association of rs7681440 with increased SNCA expression in whole blood (p=2 13 x 10-38). However, further investigation of the identified significant eQTLs is needed because the effect was seen for only one brain region. This localised effect could plausibly result from low overall expression of RP11-67M1.1 and higher RNA quality in the cerebellum than in other assayed brain regions in these datasets.

That being acknowledged, an association at the BCL7C/ STX1B locus has been previously reported for Parkinson's disease.

This is a gene-rich region of the genome (appendix p 9), making accurate nomination of the gene driving the association difficult. Mining data from the GTEx project showed that rs897984 is not an eQTL for any gene in the locus. Nonetheless, in both Parkinson's disease studies, the nominated gene at the locus was STX1B, probably due to its function as a synaptic receptor. Additionally, STX1B has a distinctive pattern of expression across tissues, presenting the highest expression in the brain. In this tissue, when compared with the closest genes in the locus (HSD3B7, BCL7C, ZNF668, MIR4519, CTF1, FBXL19, ORAI3, SETD1A, STX4), STX1B also shows the highest levels of expression (appendix p 10).

This locus also did not reach genome-wide significance with clinicopathological Alzheimer's disease dementia (p=5 21 x 10-6). The contact in 1 protein, encoded by CNTN1, is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored neuronal membrane protein that functions as a cell-adhesion molecule with important roles in axonal function. Mutations in CNTN1 were found to cause a familial form of lethal congenital myopathy. Contactin 1 drives Notch-signalling activation and modulates neuroinflammation events, possibly participating in the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis and other inflammatory disorders. A functional protein association network analysis of CNTN1 using STRING shows contactin 1 is in the same network as PSEN2 (appendix p 11), supporting its potential role in neurodegeneration. Further replication will be important in view of the absence of a genome-wide significant association in the discovery stage; however, this association seems promising. Notably, LRRK2 is located less than 500 000 base pairs away from the most associated SNP at this locus, which could suggest that the association might be driven by variation at the LRRK2 locus.

Additionally, participants with dementia with Lewy bodies were genotyped at three locations and controls were all derived from publicly available datasets, using a mixture of genotyping arrays, which could provide a source of genotyping bias. However, our approach was to select variants that were at the intersection of all used arrays before imputation, which makes use, effectively, of the same genotyping probes for all samples.
