To detect genetic modifiers of the association between current use of MHT and BC risk, we conducted a meta-analysis of four genome-wide case-only studies followed by replication in eleven case-control studies. We used a case-only design to assess interactions between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and current MHT use on risk of overall and lobular BC. The discovery stage included 2,920 cases (541 lobular) from four genome-wide association studies. The top 1,391 SNPs showing P-values for interaction (Pint) <3.0x10-03 were selected for replication using pooled case-control data from eleven studies of the Breast Cancer Association Consortium, including 7,689 cases (676 lobular) and 9,266 controls. Fixed effects meta-analysis was used to derive combined Pint. No SNP reached genome-wide significance in either the discovery or combined stage. We observed effect modification of current MHT use on overall BC risk by two SNPs on chr13 near POMP (combined Pint<=8.9x10-06), two SNPs in SLC25A21 (combined Pint<=4.8x10-05), and three SNPs in PLCG2 (combined Pint<=4.5x10-05). The association between lobular BC risk was potentially modified by one SNP in TMEFF2 (combined Pint<=2.7x10-05), one SNP in CD80 (combined Pint<=8.2x10-06), three SNPs on chr17 near TMEM132E (combined Pint<=2.2x10-06), and two SNPs on chr18 near SLC25A52 (combined Pint<=4.6x10-05).

Women with a polygenic score of three or four that were currently using MHT were at an intermediate increased risk of breast cancer. Similar results were observed for lobular breast cancer risk.

Two variants rs9579199 and rs9578047 close to FLT1 and POMP on chromosome 13 showed modifying effects on MHT associated breast cancer risk. FLT1 is a vascular endothelial growth factor receptor and involved in tumor angiogenesis. So far, no association has been reported between tumor development and POMP, a proteasome maturation protein. The variants on chromosome 14 (rs7148646, rs848694) lie in an intronic region of SLC25A21. SLC25A21 encodes an oxodicarboxylate carrier, which transports C5-C7 oxodicarboxylates across the inner membranes of mitochondria. Interestingly, the two SNPs rs6506940 and rs594334 found to modify risk of lobular breast cancer are located near another mitochondrial carrier gene, SLC25A52, on chromosome 18. Estrogen has been reported to be an important regulator of mitochondrial function and results of the present study suggest that mitochondrial related mechanisms may play a role in MHT associated breast carcinogenesis. The association between MHT and breast cancer was also modified by rs7192724, rs17202296 and rs4888190 located in intronic regions of PLCG2.

The sensitivity analysis restricted to solely population-based studies of the replication stage for selected SNPxMHT interactions did not yield substantially altered estimates for interaction (less than 7.5% for overall breast cancer and less than 11.5% for lobular breast cancer, Supplementary Table 5).

The power was reduced to 55% when restricting the sample to population-based studies.
