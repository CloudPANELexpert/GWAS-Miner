These observations are consistent with the study of Adams et al., who used an un-biased high-throughput phenotypic screen of transgenic mice and observed that knockout mice of MACROD2 presented shorter femur length compared to controls.

These loci were not reported by previous GEFOS studies. Among them, 15q22.33 contains a gene SMAD3 that is a member of several pathways participating bone metabolism, such as the WNT signaling regulation pathway and the osteoblast differentiation regulation pathway. In addition, it is also a component of the TGF-beta signaling pathway, acting as transducers of signals from TGF-beta receptors. In the canonical signaling pathway, receptor-activated SMADs are phosphorylated on C-terminal serines by the type I TGF-beta receptor, after which they partner with SMAD4. The resulting complex translocates to the nucleus where it regulates the activities of target genes. In the absence of SMAD3, TGF-beta can no longer inhibit the differentiation of osteoblast. Mice with targeted deletion of SMAD3 are osteopenic with less cortical and cancellous bone compared with wild-type littermates. Another region 11q14.2 was previously reported to be associated with bone related traits.

Noticeably, a neighboring gene BMP10 at this locus is a well-known bone candidate gene. At 7q22.1, the lead SNP rs34670419 is located at the 3'-UTR region of the ZKSCAN5 gene.
