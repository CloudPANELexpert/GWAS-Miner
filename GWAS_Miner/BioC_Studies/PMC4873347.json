The ERBB2IP gene encodes the Erbin protein, which is a binding partner of the Erb-B2 protein and regulates Erb-B2 function and localization. Erbin has also been shown to affect the Ras signaling pathway by disrupting Ras-Raf interaction. Altered expression of Erbin and Erb-B2 has been found in skin BCC tumors in a previous study, but not in SCC. The Parkinson's disease-associated gene, PARK2, has also been associated with human malignancies in previous studies, including lung cancer, glioblastoma and breast cancer, but no studies have reported on skin cancer. The precise function of this gene remains largely unknown.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 21194, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "A major strength of this study is the large sample size of pathologically confirmed SCC cases and healthy controls in this study and it is the first reported SCC GWAS so far.
