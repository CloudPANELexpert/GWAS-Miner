SSc etiology is complex and poorly understood, but similar to most autoimmune conditions it is widely accepted that the involvement of environmental and a multiplicity of genetic factors leads to disease. Data from familial, twin and ethnicity studies support the relevance of the genetic component in SSc etiology. Previous studies aimed at dissecting the genetic factors underlying SSc genetic susceptibility so far have used the candidate gene association study approach. In spite of the several years of research this strategy yielded a very limited characterization of SSc genetic risk factors. Except for the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) genes, that are relevant genetic markers for SSc across populations, few other loci outside the HLA region demonstrated strong and reproducible associations with SSc susceptibility. Only very recently, large case-control association studies have identified STAT4 and IRF5 genes as novel genetic factors contributing to SSc susceptibility. Similar to other complex genetic disorders it is expected that several genetic markers contribute to SSc predisposition with modest effects, and large sample sizes are required to detect novel disease associated loci.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 2460, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Therefore, we aimed more comprehensively to identify novel SSc susceptibility loci and thus conducted the first genome wide association study (GWAS) in SSc including a total of 2296 SSc patients and 5171 healthy controls from four case-control series of Caucasian ancestry (USA, Spain, Germany and The Netherlands) (Supplementary Table 1).

To adjust for potential population stratification we applied a genomic control correction to the test statistics. The potential effect of population substructure was tested by deriving principal components on a population-specific basis. We observed that case and control individuals in each population were not significantly different by principal components and were therefore well genetically matched.

The SNPs showing the strongest GWAS association on each region (rs2056626 for CD247, rs10515998 for CDH7 and rs4959270 for EXOC2/IRF4) were genotyped in the replication cohorts using TaqMan 5' allelic discrimination assay technology.

The combined analysis of the GWAS and replication cohort for this SNP revealed highly significant association (P =3.39x10-9 OR 0.86 95 % CI 0.81-0.90). The association of the SNPs in the CDH7 and EXOC2/IRF4 regions was not confirmed in this replication cohort (Table 2 and Supplementary figure 2). Considering that the frequency observed for the CDH7 rs10515998 genetic variant, is quite low (around 5%) the population size of the replication cohort reached only 13% of statistical power to detect an association at a significance level similar to that observed in the replication analysis (OR 1.05). Therefore, the possible implication of the CDH7 locus in SSc genetic predisposition should be still further investigated. In contrast, due to the high MAF frequency of the rs4959270 polymorphism in the EXOC2/IRF4 region, great heterogeneity of the association was observed in the replication cohorts (supplementary figure 1). These findings are concordant with previous GWAS studies in which great population allelic heterogeneity has been reported for EXOC2/IRF4 genetic variants leading to not true disease associations, as possibly occurred in our screening phase. Interestingly, the novel identified SSc susceptibility locus, CD247, participates in the regulation of the immune response and thus could have a role in SSc pathogenesis. The CD247 gene encodes the T-cell receptor zeta (CD3zeta) subunit, a component of the T cell receptor (TCR)/CD3 complex. This chain plays an important role in the assembly and transport of the TCR/CD3 complex to the cell surface and is crucial to receptor signaling function. It has been observed that the expression of the CD3zeta chain is altered in chronic autoimmune/inflammatory disorders and that its low expression results in impaired immune response. Notably, the CD247 gene has been associated with susceptibility to systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), another systemic autoimmune disease. Moreover, genetic variants in the 3' untranslated region of this gene have shown functional implication leading to a reduced expression of this molecule that could be manifested by systemic autoimmunity.

The Meta-analysis of the four study series was conducted using standard methods based on Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test. Breslow-Day test was performed for all SNPs to assess heterogeneity of the effect in different populations.
