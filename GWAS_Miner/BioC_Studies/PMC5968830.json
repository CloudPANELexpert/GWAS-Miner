Common etiological subtypes of ischemic stroke include large-artery atherosclerotic stroke (LAS), cardioembolic stroke (CES), and stroke caused by small-vessel disease (small-vessel stroke (SVS)), which is also the leading cause of ICH. Previous genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in predominantly European-ancestry groups have identified ten loci robustly associated with stroke.

Gene names in bold indicate that the variant is located within the gene; in other cases, the first gene corresponds to the closest gene, whereas additional gene names indicate eQTL signals from multiple studies, or from both eQTLs and meQTLs, or genes previously suspected to be causal (LDLR), with a maximum of two genes reported. The lead SNPs in ILF3-SLC44A2 and SMARCA-LDLR are in low LD (r2 = 0.082).
