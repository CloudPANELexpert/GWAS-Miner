However, these findings have not been widely accepted or incorporated into the dominant paradigms that explain the etiology of political ideology. This has been attributed in part to measurement and sample limitations, as well the relative absence of molecular genetic studies. Here we present results from original analyses of a combined sample of over 12,000 twins pairs, ascertained from nine different studies conducted in five democracies, sampled over the course of four decades. We provide evidence that genetic factors play a role in the formation of political ideology, regardless of how ideology is measured, the era, or the population sampled. The only exception is a question that explicitly uses the phrase \"Left-Right\". We then present results from one of the first genome-wide association studies on political ideology using data from three samples: a 1990 Australian sample involving 6,894 individuals from 3,516 families; a 2008 Australian sample of 1,160 related individuals from 635 families and a 2010 Swedish sample involving 3,334 individuals from 2,607 families. No polymorphisms reached genome-wide significance in the meta-analysis. The combined evidence suggests that political ideology constitutes a fundamental aspect of one's genetically informed psychological disposition, but as Fisher proposed long ago, genetic influences on complex traits will be composed of thousands of markers of very small effects and it will require extremely large samples to have enough power in order to identify specific polymorphisms related to complex social traits.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 1961, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "More than half a century of research in genetics, neuroscience and psychology has demonstrated that human behaviors, including social and political attitudes, are influenced by genetic and neurobiological factors (for a review see). Lindon Eaves, Hans Eysenck and Nicholas Martin pioneered this radical departure, finding that genetic variance accounted for a substantial portion of individual differences in conservatism, sub-dimensions of social, economic and defense ideologies, as well as individual social and political attitudes. Additional twin and extended kinship studies which included parents, non-twin siblings, spouses, and twins reared apart confirmed these earlier results and found that most individual political attitudes were influenced by a combination of genetic effects (which explain between 30 and 60% of variance) and environmental influence. In this way, children resemble their parents because of their genetic relatedness as much as parental upbringing and social environments.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 2966, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The notion of a genetically informed model of attitudes and ideology, understood as a psychological disposition that guides behavior, independent of, and interacting with, social forces presented a fundamental challenge to the dominant rational choice and behaviorist social science paradigms (for a review see). Yet, despite the growing body of evidence that genetic factors play an important role in the development and maintenance of political attitudes, the role of genetic influences on individual differences remains largely absent in the greater discourse on political ideology. Rather, the literature in the social sciences regarding the development and transmission of political values, remains largely focused on social and cultural mechanisms and the belief that human beings long ago transcended any genetic history that guides social behavior. In this model, elite discourse is believed to create the frames of reference through which social forces and personal experience influence parents, who in turn socialize their offspring into predictable ideological patterns.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 4048, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "This lack of integration of the social and genetic paradigms of ideology could be attributed to five primary sources. First, the evidence for the majority of findings that genes have some role in ideological formation or transmission has relied on three samples, two in the U.S. from Virginia and Minnesota based registries and one from the Australian Twin Registry. Most of the subjects were ascertained in the 1980's and early 1990's. In fact, with the exception of the Minnesota twins reared apart studies, most of the papers that explored the genetic influences on political attitudes relied on the Eaves and Martin samples, thereby limiting generalizability and independent replication of results.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 4755, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Second, almost all of the published genetic studies of attitudes and ideology have relied on a single type of measure, the Attitude Inventory (for an exception see). While the operational definition of ideology is understood to refer to the grouping of attitudes to form some type of coherent political framework or worldview, which can then be used to guide behavior, and is not unlike the Wilson-Patterson (WP) inventory, the WP is not one of the standard measures commonly used to assess ideology in political science, the field which has been the most preoccupied with understanding the formation and function of political ideology. Specifically, there are a series of measures that have provided the ability to categorize human behavior in meaningful ways that have remained somewhat consistent across time and location, and are considered valid measures of ideology by both political scientists and psychologists. Indeed, most empirical explorations of ideological beliefs rely on self-identification measures of liberalism and conservatism, measures of authoritarianism, and more global measures of ideology that focus on collectivism, individualism, egalitarianism, freedom and equality, rather than the more psychometrically designed attitude inventory such as a WP scale (for a review see). So far, these measures have remained absent from behavioral genetic analyses. Thus, the heterogeneity between the measures used to test more standard social science hypotheses regarding ideology versus the WP measure used in most twin studies has drawn criticism (e.g.,), limiting the integration of biological factors into mainstream conceptualizations of political ideology.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 6433, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Third, the epistemological divide that exists between the life and social sciences has contributed to the lack of acceptance of behavior genetic theory and methods (e.g., see). This is particularly true regarding the majority of genetically informed studies of ideology, which have relied on quantitative models of twins, adoptees and kinships. The theoretical premise and statistical methods behind these approaches are foreign to most social scientists making it difficult for many to effectively evaluate and integrate this research into their own work. Indeed, a recent publication in Political Analysis, the journal considered to be the leading methods journal in political science, claimed that twin models do not account for gene-environment interaction and twin researchers are unaware of the possibility of gene-environment interplay (see), despite the thousands of publications that show otherwise (for a response and review see). Behavior genetic approaches have also inspired philosophical objections due to the firm belief that behavioral differences are entirely socialized. Several publications in the political science literature have begun to erode this view and explicate the theoretical and empirical justification for inclusion of genetic influences and biological mechanisms in general, including gene-environment interplay. Nevertheless, normative criticisms of twin models, often couched in the equal environments assumption emerged, recapitulating the debates of decades ago.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 7933, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "On the surface, equal environments violations for politics would appear to be a functional impossibility. Parents would have to decide to raise their twins more similarly if they were monozygotic than if they were dizygotic twins, and to operationalize the differential rearing by liberal versus conservative children in the same household. That is, they would have to be systematically raising one child more liberal or conservative than the other, during the same time-period. This is not to say parents do not treat children differently in other domains. This occurs, for example, when parents react differently to different children depending on the children's personality (e.g.,). However, this would be a type of reactive heritability and not a violation of the equal environment assumption. Nevertheless, a series of studies have empirically addressed this criticism regarding political orientations. extended kinship analyses found no special twin environments existed for political attitudes; partitioned common variance into that which is shared and that specific to each twin, and found explicit differences in rearing had little influence on the heritability of attitudes or ideology; relied on a gene-environment interaction design and found sharing a room, attending the same class and other similarity-in-rearing measures had almost no influence on the heritability of ideology. One of the most powerful tests for unequal environments on attitudes was conducted by and later by, in which MZ and DZ twins were assessed for attitudes from ages 9-18 every 2 years. They found no differences in co-twin similarity on attitudes by zygosity type throughout childhood, but once children left home DZ correlations dropped. That is, the home environment kept DZ twins more similar, not more different.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 9743, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The fourth criticism focused on assigning the genetic influences on ideology to other related psychological traits. The most prominent hypothesis in this vein is the belief that political ideologies and attitudes are merely manifestations of personality, and it is the genetic influence on personality that is being measured through univariate studies on attitudes and ideology (e.g.,). However a series of papers by Verhulst and colleagues challenged this view by decomposing the variance between personality traits and ideologies, finding that while the majority of the relationship between the two resided at the genetic level, the majority of genetic variance remained unique to attitudes and ideologies. Furthermore, employing a direction of causation model and relying on longitudinal analyses, found that if there was a causal flow it would operate through attitudes and not personality, and that changes in personality over time did not result in changes in attitudes over time (also see). In essence, whatever genetic influences account for individual differences on attitudes and ideologies they are not subsumed by other covariates, but they remain quite specific to ideological differences.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 10946, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Finally, findings of genetic transmission of political attitudes from parents to their children have largely relied on estimates of genetic variance at a latent level, and have remained agnostic as to the identity of the specific genetic variants involved. Thus, the results appear like a black box to many social scientists; something is happening at the genetic level, but the specific genetic variants and mechanisms underlying the neurobiological pathways by which attitudes are formed and maintained, remained out of reach. Moreover, some have argued that without specific genetic and neurobiological systems to focus on, integrating genetic research into testable hypotheses and modifying extant conceptions of ideology remains abstract. Therefore, critics have claimed that heritability studies offer little value.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 11768, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "There have been a handful of \"candidate gene\" studies proposing a link between specific genetic variants and specific political traits, including monoamine oxidase (MAO) with behavioral aggression, serotonin and MAO with voting participation and dopamine with partisanship. However, similar to the study of other complex human traits, these candidate gene studies have found only nominally significant results and have not withstood long-term replication. Single SNP studies also raise concerns about reliability and false positives. In general, genome-wide approaches have begun to provide more clarity, and have yielded more reproducible genetic associations than any other approach . However, a recent series of works have found that it will take extremely large sample sizes to have enough power to identify individual genetic variants related to complex social traits (e.g.,). This is a particularly daunting scenario for researchers who focus on political attitudes and ideologies; unlike health related conditions, there are no funding mechanisms to support large genotyping efforts on social traits. Thus, so far only two genome wide studies published have attempted to identify quantitative trait loci (QTLs) responsible for variation in measures of political attitudes using small samples., relying on genome wide linkage of 13,000 individuals assessed for political attitudes, found 3 genomic regions putatively containing quantitative trait loci accounting for some 8-13 percent of the variation in Liberalism-Conservatism. The significant and suggestive regions included genes thought to be part of the dopaminergic, serotoninergic, NMDA and olfactory pathways. However, the resolution of linkage mapping is typically very low and is better suited to identify genes of large effects, and not individual variants that are typically very small for complex traits. then conducted genome wide association analyses of certain attitudes on 3,233 individuals in Sweden, and found no markers that approached significance.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 13799, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Here we address the previously unanswered criticisms surrounding the sample and measurement limitations and the relative absence of genome wide explorations, through two sets of original empirical analyses.

Using nine samples taken from five countries, over four decades, and employing a wide variety of measures to assess ideology, we found a common genetic influence across all samples and measures, with one exception. The phrase \"Left-Right\" in European countries takes on a different context than the terms liberal or conservative, or those ideologies formed from political attitude positions. Indeed, the phrase \"Left-Right\" appears highly subject to local and cultural definitions and may indicate group identification more than ideological position. For example, in Sweden the term \"Left-Right\" is strongly-related to party identification and voting behavior. The finding that the environment accounts for nearly all the variation on measures which use the phrase \"Left-Right\" is similar to explorations of party identification in the US during the 1980's and 1990's, which find that ideology is heritable, but party identification is not. This might change however, if the measures are taken on a population or during a time period where the correlation between ideology and group identification is high (e.g., see Fazekas and Littvay forthcoming). Outside of the phrase \"Left-Right\", the influence of genetic factors on the development of political ideology appears to be reasonably uniform across time, measure and country, while the influence of common and unique environmental factors differs with the shifting political and social factors in various circumstances.

Hungary has only just begun to reestablish its democratic identity, and the freedoms to consider a wider range of political values.

In such a framework, there is scope for the roles of gene-environment interplay, including genetic expression, operating in social environments that change with the changing roles of an individual's life and disposition (e.g.,).

Rather, thousands of genetic variants of very small effects and constellations of genes interact with each other and the environment to influence behavior, indirectly. For social and behavioral traits, such as political attitudes and ideologies, in which measures and definitions change as a function of time, location and climate, sample size and measurement limitations present a challenge. Even if we could ensure the perfect measure, the plethora of relevant individual genes and their complex interactions with other genes, as well as the environment counsel against expecting that any individual genetic markers could explain a sizable amount of the genetic variance in political temperament and without a very large sample, identifying genes of small effects is unlikely.

Thus, future studies that identify genetic and environmental pathways by which genes influence the regulation of hormonal, cognitive and emotive states, which in turn influences the selection into, interpretation of, and reaction to, environmental stimuli relevant to political values, may eventually provide the necessary glue to combine the multitude of neurobiological influences on ideology captured across the sciences.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 38172, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "In summary, the findings suggest that while genes undoubtedly matter in the aggregate for the development of political attitudes, individual common variants will have small effects on ideology.
