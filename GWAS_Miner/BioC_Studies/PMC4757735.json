The second panel shows the recombination rate in the area and the third panel shows the positions of genes. X-axis is the physical position in the genome. In grey are the association results from the unconditional analysis with green dots representing the new functional candidate SNPs. Black dots are the results from the conditional analysis.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 46417, "infons": {"file": "emss-67068-f0004.jpg", "id": "F3", "section_type": "FIG", "type": "fig_caption"}, "text": "Proportion of total trait variance explained by the lead-SNPs and functional SNPs.

In case multiple candidate variants were observed in a locus, multiple linear regression models were fitted to explore the effect of each individual SNP and of all SNPs together.
