This locus extends across the CYP2C18- CYP2C19-CYP2C9-CYP2C8 gene cluster. CYP2C19 was a strong biological candidate because this enzyme is a key activator of the antiplatelet function of clopidogrel. Indeed, follow-up genotyping indicated that the common loss-of-function CYP2C19*2 variant was associated with clopidogrel response and could account for most of the association signal detected in the initial genome-wide association study.

In addition to the replication of the initial association between CYP2C19*2 genotype and clopidogrel response, the Baltimore Sinai Hospital cohort demonstrates generalizability to an outbred population with significant atherosclerotic disease. Importantly, the association between CYP2C19*2 genotype and cardiovascular event-free survival in this high-risk population provides evidence for clinical relevance. A limitation is that the Sinai Hospital cohort was a mixed population that received differing regimens of antiplatelet agents in the acute setting (1-3 days). However, our stratified analyses did not detect any significant effect of acute management on the longer-term outcomes investigated. Furthermore, we cannot rule out the possibility that a subset of patients were nonadherent to clopidogrel. Our data show that there is no relationship between CYP2C19 genotype and platelet aggregation in the absence of clopidogrel. Thus, the differences in platelet aggregation we observed between genotypes once clopidogrel treatment was initiated strongly suggest that a large proportion of the population did indeed adhere to the clopidogrel regimen.
