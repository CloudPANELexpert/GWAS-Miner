These findings suggest that complex genetic mechanisms are present for XFS pathogenesis, and the possibility that additional susceptibility loci for XFS remain to be identified.

These data suggest risk for XFS increases approximately 1.16 fold for each copy of the minor G allele (Figure 1 and Supplementary Table 4).

It is flanked closely by recombination events (Figure 2) and is confined to its own linkage disequilibrium (LD) block (Supplementary Figure 3). We did not observe association with any genetic marker surpassing the nominal threshold of P < 0.001 outside of this critical region (Figure 2). We next performed imputation for unobserved SNPs at the CACNA1A locus on the basis of 1,000 Genomes cosmopolitan project data using the Phase 3 release (June 2014, see Methods) across the GWAS discovery collection. We were able to successfully impute 5602 SNPs across the CACNA1A locus. However, subsequent association analysis utilizing the imputed SNPs did not identify additional genetic associations that surpassed the statistical significance of rs4926244 (Supplementary Figure 4). Notably, the most significant SNPs emerging from the cosmopolitan imputation analysis are intronic and are all moderate-to-highly correlated with rs4926244 (Supplementary Table 5). None of these correlated SNP markers lies in strong motifs for transcription factor binding sites as identified by ENCODE. They also do not tag any common non-synonymous variants in CACNA1A (Supplementary Table 6). Haplotype association analysis assessing SNPs in a 2, 3, and 4 marker sliding window did not reveal evidence of association surpassing that observed for rs4926244 (lowest haplotype P-value = 0.00021; Supplementary Table 7), and we further note that all but one haplotype showing evidence of association exceeding P < 0.0005 in the GWAS dataset contained SNP rs4926244 (Supplementary Table 7). This suggests that rs4926244 is likely driving the common-variant haplotype association results, and that detailed fine-mapping of this locus using deep re-sequencing may be required. Examination of a recently available large-scale eQTL mapping database indicates the risk allele G at rs4926244 is modestly correlated with lower CACNA1A mRNA levels in peripheral blood cells (Z=-3.00, P=0.0027), suggesting that it may influence XFS risk through an effect on CACNA1A expression.

The strength of this association vastly exceeded that of marker rs3825942 (responsible for a p.G153D substitution in exon 1 of LOXL1), which has been the most widely tested and reported SNP association prior to this analysis. Performing the analysis after conditioning for the allele dosage of rs4886776 extinguished the signal of association for every other genetic marker within the LOXL1 locus. Conversely, conditioning the analysis for allele dosage at rs3825942 still resulted in genome-wide significant association at many of the other LOXL1 SNPs, including rs4886776 (Supplementary Table 8). These data suggest that within the Japanese GWAS discovery set, the observed association at LOXL1 can be attributed to rs4886776 alone. We note that rs4886776 is in high LD with rs1048661 (r2=0.98 in 1000 genomes Asians), a SNP responsible for another non-synonymous substitution (p.R141L) in LOXL1 but was not directly genotyped in our dataset.

Expression of different CACNA1A isoforms appear to be higher in human ocular tissue-derived cells than in cells of non-ocular origin (Supplementary Figure 6, panel B). Immunofluorescence and immunohistochemistry analysis was also performed on adult human eyes which showed positive immunoreactivity for CACNA1A in multiple human ocular tissues (Figure 3, Supplementary Figure 7 & 8). The distribution of CACNA1A was similar in human ocular tissues of individuals with or without XFS (Figure 3, Supplementary Figures 8 & 9). Positive staining and localization of CACNA1A in the human eye was further corroborated by immunofluorescence microscopy analysis in mouse eyes. (Supplementary Figure 10). In the human eyes, we observed positive CACNA1A immunoreactivity in the ciliary body and iris (Figure 3). Positive staining of CACNA1A was also seen in the anterior lens epithelium but not in the acellular capsule and the cornea (Supplementary Figure 7 & 9). The optic nerve glia and vascular endothelial cells also showed positive immunoreactivity with CACNA1A (Supplementary Figure 9).

The ciliary body and iris smooth musculature had CACNA1A positive immunostaining but were negatively stained for LOXL1 in both XFS and non-XFS eyes (Figure 3).

The SNPs with call rates of less than 95%, minor allele frequency of less than 1 percent, or showing significant deviation from Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium (P-value for deviation < 1 x 10-6) were removed from further statistical analysis. Likewise, samples with an overall genotyping success rate of less than 95% were removed from further analysis. The remaining samples were then subjected to biological relationship verification by using the principle of variability in allele sharing. Identity-by-state information was derived using PLINK (see URLs). For those pairs of individuals who showed evidence of cryptic relatedness (possibly either due to duplicated or biologically related samples), we removed the sample with the lower call rate before performing principal component (PC) analysis. PC analysis was undertaken to account for spurious associations resulting from ancestral differences of individual SNPs and PC plots were performed using the R statistical program package (see URLs). For the GWAS discovery stage, all XFS cases had genetically matched controls as visualized spatially on PC analysis (Supplementary Figures 11a and 11b). A total of 581,023 autosomal SNPs passed quality filters for call rate and minor allele frequency (see Methods) and were included for further analysis. Genotypes were contrasted between XFS cases and controls using logistic regression, with adjustments for the top 6 principal components of genetic ancestry to further minimize confounding due to cryptic population stratification. We did not observe any evidence of genomic inflation (lambdagc = 1; Supplementary Figure 12), suggesting that the association results were not confounded by external artefacts such as genetic mismatch between cases and controls. Crucially, we did not observe any deviation or dispersion of test statistics when patients with XFS without glaucoma were compared to patients with exfoliation glaucoma (Supplementary Figure 13).
