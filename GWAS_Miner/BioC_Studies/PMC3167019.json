For example, Zhou et al. reported that the ERCC1 8092C>A variant allele was associated with a 50% increased risk of death in Stage III (A+B) and IV NSCLC patients, while Wu et al. observed that the variant A allele was significantly associated with a shorter OS (HR = 0.68, 95%CI. 0.48-0.95). These previous studies indicate that the effects of each individual SNP are modest and suggest that additional SNPs/genes and/or other possible genetic mechanisms such as CpG methylation or copy number variation might influence response to platinum-based therapy.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 23121, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "With advances in genotyping and gene expression technologies, several studies have taken an unbiased approach towards understanding genetic factors influencing response to platinum-based chemotherapy. In LCLs obtained from pedigrees of Centr d'Etudes du polymorphism Human (CEPH) individuals of European background, it was estimated that 30-40% of the variation in cisplatin-induced cytotoxicity was due to heritable factors. Using this cell line model system, those investigators subsequently identified several genetic variants that contributed to cisplatin and carboplatin cytotoxicity. However, the results of those studies have not been replicated in cancer patients treated with platinum-based chemotherapeutics. Our genome-wide pharmacogenomics analysis did not confirm those variants associated with response to cisplatin. The difference could be due to differences between populations from which these LCLs are derived. In Huang's study, the LCLs derived from CEU, European descent and YRI, African descent while our LCLs derived from CA, AA and HCA. It could also be due to confounding factors associated with the use of LCLs, such as cell growth rate and ATP levels. Therefore, we performed siRNA screening for selected candidate genes to pursue the underlying biology. Several previous studies have suggested an important contribution of trans-acting variants to individual variation in human gene expression. Among the genes tested, knockdown of DAPK3 and METTL6, for which expression levels correlated with the rs11169748 and rs2440915 SNPs, significantly decreased cisplatin sensitivity in three lung cancer cell lines, although METTL6 expression levels were not significantly associated with cisplatin IC50 in LCLs, suggesting a potential difference between LCLs and lung cancer cell lines.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 24934, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "DAPK3, also known as zipper interacting protein kinase (ZIPK) or DAPK like kinase (DLK), is a member of the DAPK family. DAPK was initially identified as being encoded by a gene whose reduced expression, mediated by antisense cDNA transfection, protected HeLa cells from gamma interferon-induced cell death. DAPK3 contains several putative nuclear localization signal sequences and a leucine zipper domain, required for homo-oligomerization, interaction with other leucine zipper-containing proteins and for its death-promoting effects. DAPK3 has been shown to play distinct roles in tumor suppression and the regulation of apoptosis. We have shown that knockdown of DAPK3 significantly decreased cisplatin sensitivity in lung cancer cell lines and might be related to OS of NSCLC patients treated with platinum-based therapy.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 25761, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "METTL6 belongs to the methyltransferase superfamily. It has been suggested that chemoresistance and toxicity associated with platinum compound treatment might be mediated through methylation-dependent gene silencing. For example, methylation of FANCF, a gene associated with Fanconi anemia, confers cisplatin sensitivity in ovarian cancer cell lines. Additionally, Ramirez et al. observed that 14-3-3o, a cell cycle checkpoint gene, is methylated in one third of NSCLC patients and that methylation is related to better median OS for these patients.

Our results provide important insight into novel genes and mechanisms that may contribute to variation in response to platinum drug therapy. Most of our patients with advanced NSCLC were treated with cisplatin combination therapy, often with the addition of other chemotherapeutics, radiation or surgery. Even though the SNPs that we tested were selected based on their association with cisplatin cytotoxicity in LCLs, we can not exclude the possibility of potential interaction of genetic variation with other treatments and their effect on cisplatin treatment outcome in patients with lung cancer. Therefore, it is particularly important that our functional studies confirmed the functional effects of these genes in cisplatin response in vitro.
