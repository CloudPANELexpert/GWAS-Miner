To determine which aspect(s) of BMI are influenced by the variants we identified, we analyzed their association with the different anthropometric components of BMI, and also with a more direct measure of adiposity, percentage fat mass. All of the variants had much stronger associations with weight than with height (Supplementary Tables 6 and 8), with the exception that for KCTD15 and MTCH2 the small effects on BMI in stage 2 samples limited our ability to dissect the effect on BMI into its constituent components. Variation at MC4R was significantly associated with adult height, as previously reported. To measure more directly the effects on adiposity, we tested these variants for association with percentage fat mass in a meta-analysis of three cohorts of adults in which percent fat mass was assessed (EPIC-Norfolk, Botnia PPP and METSIM; total n = 18,279), and also in the children from ALSPAC in whom percent body fat mass was measured at age 11 (n = 4,876).

The two most significantly BMI-associated SNPs immediately flank the 45-kb deletion and are in perfect LD with it (r2 = 1.0) across all HapMap analysis panels. Indeed, what initially seemed to be a long associated haplotype (the 47.3 kb spanned by these SNPs on the reference genome sequence) is in fact a short haplotype whose major feature is the absence of 45.6 kb of the reference sequence (Fig. 4c). The 45-kb deletion is therefore a strong candidate to explain the association signal at NEGR1.

SH2B1 is a strong prior candidate for regulating body weight. SH2B1 is implicated in leptin signaling, and Sh2b1-null mice are obese. Notably, the obesity in Sh2b1-null mice can be reversed by targeted Sh2b1 expression in neurons, suggesting that the effects of this gene on obesity are mediated through the CNS. KCTD15, TMEM18 and GNPDA2 have unknown functions, whereas MTCH2 encodes a putative mitochondrial carrier protein that may function in cellular apoptosis, and NEGR1 has a role in neuronal outgrowth. Although fine mapping and other experimental approaches will be required to identify and confirm the causal variant(s) and gene(s) for each locus, we note that, with the exception of SH2B1, our newly associated loci do not include obvious or previously studied candidate genes.

Disruption in mice of Mc4r, Sh2b1 and Bdnf (all genes that seem to be involved in signaling in the brain) results in hyperphagia and/or obesity, and both Fto and Sh2b1 show diet- or obesity-related changes in expression in hypothalamus. Further general support for a neuronal basis for obesity comes from the observation that NEGR1 is thought to affect neuronal outgrowth. Finally, the effect of variants that map to a gene desert between GNPDA2 (Supplementary Fig. 3) and GABRA2 (ref.) might be mediated by GABRA2, which affects addiction behavior.

The SH2B1 result also illustrates some of the difficulties in interpreting associations with gene expression levels, as the presence of a missense SNP in SH2B1 and the strong prior candidacy of this gene would seem to implicate strongly alteration in SH2B1 function as the causal mechanism for influencing obesity. One possibility is that the SH2B1 variant has a causal role but happens to be in LD with a different variant that influences EIF3C and TUFM mRNA levels; alternatively, regulation of EIF3C or TUFM mRNA levels could have a causal role, instead of or in addition to variation in SH2B1.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 22858, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Logistically, one important challenge in executing our study was coordinating analysis strategies and phenotype modeling across 15 different cohorts, each with specific genotyping, phenotyping, trait modeling and analytical strategies.

There are several possible explanations, which require further experimentation to explore. First, there may be many more loci with common variants that influence BMI. We can predict that additional loci will be discovered by similarly sized studies in new samples: because we had only 5-10% power to detect variants such as those at KCTD15, MTCH2 and NEGR1, dozens of additional variants with comparable effect sizes likely remain unidentified. The number of common variants with smaller effects, and which might be detected with larger samples, is harder to predict, as this depends on the allelic architecture; if the number of causal variants increases as effect sizes decrease, then increasing sample size will be especially productive. Modifying effects such as interactions with environmental factors, other genetic variants, age, sex or other variables may, if substantial, also diminish apparent effect sizes, so detailed analyses of interaction with validated variants may be informative. Finally, other than the MC4R coding region, these loci have not yet been explored thoroughly for additional rare (or common) variants. As such, it is not known whether additional variants at these loci (those causal for the index association or those representing independent causal events) could explain a greater fraction of BMI variation. There are a growing number of examples, including at MC4R, where genes containing common variants associated with a particular phenotype also harbor lower-frequency, higher-penetrance variants with more severe phenotypic consequences. Comprehensive sequencing studies in these and other loci (perhaps in individuals with extreme obesity) may represent a path to finding such variants and beginning to explore the relative contributions of common and rare variation to BMI. Discovering additional variants will slowly increase predictive power.

Frequency of effect allele, weighted frequency of the effect allele (and the proxy SNP for those loci where more than one SNP was typed) in genotyped population-based cohorts (EPIC, FINRISK97, BPPP, METSIM). Per-allele change in BMI, the change in BMI per increase in the effect allele (with 95% confidence interval) from stage 2 genotyped population-based cohorts. Explained variance, the average of the variance explained for the SNP used for analysis in stage 2 genotyped population-based cohorts. Stage 1, data from stage 1 GIANT meta-analysis; stage 2; data from meta-analysis of genotyped and in silico studies; stage 1 + 2, data from stage 1 GIANT analyzed with genotyped and in silico studies from stage 2.
