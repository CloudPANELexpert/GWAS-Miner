Evidence for the subtype comes from latent profile analyses, taxonometric analyses, signal detection analyses, and evaluation of the distribution of dissociative symptoms in large samples, and has been replicated in veteran, civilian, and cross-cultural samples.

Several studies suggest an association between stress-linked dissociative symptoms and blunted neurobiological reactivity. In addition, a handful of small genetic studies have reported associations between candidate genes and broadly defined dissociative symptomatology. Specifically, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in FK506 binding protein 5 (FKBP5), a gene involved in regulating the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, were associated with dissociative symptoms in hospitalized children with medical injuries and in women with a history of childhood trauma. The serotonin transporter gene (SLC6A4) has been implicated in dissociation among individuals with obsessive-compulsive disorder and trauma-exposed individuals. Finally, the catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) gene has been associated with dissociation among children with a history of abuse.

The aim of this study was to conduct a genome-wide search for polymorphisms associated with the symptoms of dissociation that define the subtype in a sample of trauma-exposed veterans and non-veterans. The phenotype was defined by severity scores on lifetime symptoms of derealization and depersonalization; this dimensional approach was expected to yield enhanced statistical power compared to use of a categorical designation of the phenotype because of the low prevalence of the subtype.

Results revealed that SNPs in two genes of interest that are relevant to fear-related memory formation and processing (rs263232 in ADCY8), and synaptic integration (rs71534169 in DPP6) reached a \"suggestive\" level of genome-wide significance in their association with symptoms of derealization and depersonalization. These SNPs were still strongly associated with dissociative phenomena after PTSD severity was controlled for, suggesting that the effects were specific to dissociation. Failure to identify individuals with the dissociative subtype of PTSD may hinder efforts to identify the biological and etiological underpinnings of PTSD. Results of this study highlight the importance of using empirically refined phenotypes in genetic association studies.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 26125, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "footnote"}, "text": "As dissociation is thought to be related to severe and early childhood trauma, we also examined the main effect of each of the 10 SNPs in the suggestive range of association while controlling for the number of reported instances of childhood sexual trauma occurring before age 13 as assessed by the Traumatic Life Events Questionnaire.
