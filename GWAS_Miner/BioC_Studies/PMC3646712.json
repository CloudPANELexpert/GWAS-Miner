No single SNP produced significant evidence for association at a genome-wide threshold, and thus larger samples will be required to search for these associations. However, a polygenic score analysis produced evidence that there is a relationship between negative/disorganized factor scores and the polygenic signal that is observed in cross-sample analyses of schizophrenia GWAS data sets, with further analyses suggesting that this effect was primarily due to disorganized symptoms (duration and severity of formal thought disorder and bizarre behavior). This suggests that at least part of the effect of multiple common SNPs is on the deteriorative course of illness that has generally been considered the hallmark of the syndrome.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 26520, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "footnote"}, "text": "All other authors report no financial relationships with commercial interests.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 26599, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "footnote"}, "text": "Members of the Genome-Wide Association Study Consortium are listed in the data supplement accompanying the online edition of this article.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 26738, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "footnote"}, "text": "The GAIN quality control team (G.R.
