We conducted a genome-wide association study of severe GI among 4077 European American adults, participants in the Dental Atherosclerosis Risk In Communities cohort. The severe GI trait was defined dichotomously using the 90th percentile of gingival index >=2 extent score. Genotyping was performed with the Affymetrix 6.0 array platform and an imputed set of 2.5 million markers, based on HapMap Phase II CEU build 36, was interrogated. Genetic models were based on logistic regression and controlled for ancestry (10 principal components), sex, age, and examination center. One locus on chromosome 17 met genome-wide statistical significance criteria:lead single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP): rs11652874 [minor allele frequency=0.06, intronic to ASIC2 (acid sensing ionic channel-2, formerly named ACCN1); odds ratio=2.1, 95% confidence interval=1.6-2.7, p=3.9x10-8]. This association persisted among subjects with severe periodontitis and was robust to adjustment for microbial plaque index. Moreover, the minor [G] allele was associated with higher levels of severe GI in stratified analyses among subsets of participants with high load of either \"red\" or \"orange\" complex pathogens, although this association was not statistically significant. While these results will require replication in independent samples and confirmation by mechanistic studies, this locus appears as a promising candidate for severe gingival inflammation.

In addition to stress exerted by the local microbial burden, it is now well-established that host genomics contributes to periodontal disease susceptibility. Twin studies by Michalowicz et al. have suggested that heritability accounts for about 50% of the total phenotypic variability of periodontal disease. More recently, in a study of more than 10,000 Swedish twin pairs, Mucci et al. reported heritability estimates of 39% and 33% for women and men, respectively.
