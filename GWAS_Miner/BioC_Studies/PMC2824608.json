In addition, evidence was observed for association with multiple SNPs in the RAD50-IL13 region for asthma susceptibility and asthma related quantitative traits. The protein encoded by RAD50 is involved in DNA double-strand break repair and its expression level is constitutively low in most tissues, thus it has no known function directly related to asthma, although MER11-RAD50-NBS1 complex has been shown to be involved in somatic hypermutation and gene conversion of immunoglobulin regions. On the contrary, other genes (IL4, IL5, and IL13) in the TH2 cytokines locus are better candidates based on their biologic functions. Three SNPs in IL13 in this study were associated with asthma.

The TH2 LCR is involved in the chromatin configuration to re-organize promoters of IL4, IL5, IL13 in proximity and co-regulation of TH2 cytokine expression. Seven Rad50 DNase I hypersensitive sites (RHS1-7) were identified, where RHS4-7 formed the core of the LCR. LCR-C (RHS7) and LCR-B (RHS6) were possible TH2 cytokine expression enhancers; LCR-A (RHS6) and LCR-O (RHS5) were likely insulators. RHS7 is essential for TH2 cytokine expression by showing TH2 specific demethylation after allergen stimulation and intrachromosomal interactions between LCR and the promoters of TH2 cytokines. Furthermore, RHS6, Rad50 promoter (RHS2), and IL5 promoter interacted with interferon gamma (Ifng) on a different chromosome, which suggests an interchromosomal regulation of the expression of TH1/TH2 cytokines.

Our results weakly replicated the findings of the other GWAS: ORMDL3 and gasdermin B (GSDML) (rs7216389) with asthma (P = 0.057); FCER1A (rs2251746) with total serum IgE (P = 0.040); CHI3L1 (rs880633) with FEV1 (P = 0.003), FVC (P = 0.031), and FEV1/FVC (P = 0.040). rs1588265 (P = 0.507) and rs1544791 (P = 0.678) in PDE4D with asthma were not replicated. GWAS of total serum IgE by Weidinger identified several SNPs in RAD50 (P < 10E-04). In our study, the most significant SNP in RAD50 for total serum IgE is rs6871536 (P = 2.61E-03).

However, evidence for multiple SNPs was observed in our results in this comprehensively phenotyped relatively homogeneous cohort of difficult-to-treat asthmatics from the larger TENOR study. Our control datasets (general population and phenotyped controls) both have some limitations. They were both significantly younger (see Table I) than TENOR cases, making our results a little conservative because some controls might become asthma cases in the future. Genotyping confirmation and fine-mapping of candidate regions were impossible since the Illumina controls were from a public database, but our approach compensated for this by using imputation.
