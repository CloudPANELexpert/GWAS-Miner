Calmodulin signaling has been widely implicated in AD pathogenesis (see the study by O'Day and Myre for a review). In addition to identifying common variants that are associated with disease susceptibility, we included an interaction term between disease status and the additive SNP effect in the analysis. Implementing this model with our QTs, we identified 24 SNPs correlated with the brain regions at P-values <10-5 and one SNP <10-6 (Supplementary Table 3). The most significant SNP (ERV; P-value = 3.45 x 10~) is in an intron in the ZNF292 gene, which codes for a zinc-finger protein expressed in the brain. Our disease-specific analysis highlights the association between the minor allele of this SNP (rs1925690) and increased entorhinal cortical volume (Supplementary Figure 6) in AD subjects, whereas the converse is evident in control individuals.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 24237, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Our analysis suggests further evidence for the PICALM locus in neurodegeneration.
