In our results, we found that a common SNP in the APOC1/APOE region (rs445925) is associated with Clinical ideal CV health although this association appears to be driven largely by lipid levels. This specific SNP has been identified in previous GWAS to be associated with higher risk of coronary heart disease, greater common carotid IMT and carotid plaque, and long-term higher LDL levels in older adults as well as in childhood through young adulthood. Additionally, SNPs in the APOC1/APOE region have been associated with Alzheimer's disease, longevity, lipids and metabolic syndrome. In our study we found that the A (minor) allele was associated with an increase in the odds of being in Ideal CV Health; this is consistent with the prior studies of CHD, carotid IMT and LDL cholesterol, in which the A (minor) allele was associated with a negative beta or decreased odds of disease. Our findings suggest that the effect of rs445925 on ideal CV health is likely mediated by its impact on LDL cholesterol levels. The SNP rs445925 remained significantly associated with ideal CV health in exome chip analyses even after adjustment for SNP rs7412 in the APOE region.

In peripheral tissues, APOE mediates cholesterol metabolism while in the central nervous system it is involved in cholesterol transport. The APOE E2 allele (characterized by two SNPs including rs7412 in high LD with our top SNP rs445925) binds poorly to the cell surface receptors and has been shown to be associated with lower LDL-C levels, type III hyperlipoproteinemia and Parkinson's disease. In more recent GWAS studies, SNPs in the APOE locus appear to have pleiotropic effects beyond simply lipid metabolism. Among African Americans of the PAGE study, variants in the APOE region were found to be associated with multiple components of metabolic syndrome. In addition to its effect on the functional form of APOE, rs445925 may also play a role in APOE expression.

In addition, hypercholesterolemia tends to precede the development of other risk factors more often than would be expected by chance. These findings generate the hypothesis that persons with low lipid levels may be less likely to manifest other risk factors, and thus that individuals with the affected allele who are more likely to have ideal lipid levels may thus maintain ideal levels of the other risk factors as well (a.k.a. Ideal CV Health). Although lifestyle factors likely play an important role in ideal CV health, our GRS analyses reinforce the role that genetic predisposition to low LDL and possibly low triglycerides is an important contributor to ideal CV health and suggest that certain individuals with a beneficial genetic background (e.g. to lower LDL) are more likely to achieve ideal CV health.

In addition, ideal CV health is a relatively low prevalence phenotype. In future replication studies, larger sample sizes may be needed to replicate and extend these findings as we are likely to have been underpowered to detect a more complete repertoire of loci with more modest effects on ideal CV health. In addition to the known important impact of lifestyle modifications, we here have identified evidence for lipid gene variation that underlies ideal CV health.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 23111, "infons": {"section_type": "SUPPL", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "Supplementary Material", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 23134, "infons": {"section_type": "SUPPL", "type": "footnote"}, "text": "This is a PDF file of an unedited manuscript that has been accepted for publication.
