In part, the difficulty with cognitive GWAS may be caused by the relative heterogeneity in the measurement of the cognitive phenotype. Traditionally, general cognitive ability (g) has been defined as a latent trait underlying shared variance across multiple subdomains of cognitive performance, psychometrically obtained as the first principal component of several distinct neuropsychological test scores. Using this approach, several cognitive GWAS with fewer than 20,000 subjects yielded no genome-wide significant (GWS) effects, while a few GWS loci were identified in larger GWAS of 35,298 and 53,949 subjects, respectively. By contrast, two independent GWAS of height with sample sizes of approximately 30,000 subjects each yielded 20-30 GWS hits; allelic effect sizes were ~2-5 times larger than the largest obtained in cognitive GWAS (Trampush et al., 2015).", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 2558, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Very recently, a cognitive GWAS was able to leverage a very brief measure of fluid intelligence, highly correlated with psychometrically defined g, obtained in over 50,000 subjects.

However, by utilizing a single-item measure (years of education completed), obtained incidentally in large studies of other phenotypes, this approach has allowed investigators to obtain extremely large sample sizes. A recent study of educational attainment in nearly 300,000 individuals identified 74 independent GWS loci. Moreover, a new technique called multi-trait analysis of GWAS (MTAG) has been developed which permits integration of GWAS data across related traits, accounting for the possibility of overlapping samples across studies, and requiring only summary statistics. The developers of MTAG demonstrated its accuracy and utility in a study of traits (depression, neuroticism, and subjective well-being) that demonstrate genetic correlations in the range of ~.70-.75; importantly, the genetic correlation between cognitive performance and educational attainment has been consistently reported to be in the same range.

While developmental disorders primarily affecting oligodendrocytes, such as metachromatic leukodystrophy, are marked by cognitive impairment, it is possible that individual variation in cognitive ability within the normal range is less directly under genetic control via white matter mechanisms. By contrast, strong evidence was provided for the involvement of genes expressed in the cerebellum. Converging evidence from functional imaging studies, lesion studies, structural connectivity, and evolutionary considerations strongly implicate a role for cerebellum in higher cognitive functions, possibly through the mechanism of prediction and error-based learning.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 23790, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "By utilizing TWAS methodology, we were able to isolate expression effects of specific genes within some of our broad GWAS loci.

However, most of the genes implicated by TWAS were clustered in a few \"hot\" genomic loci, which may represent topologically associated domains (TADs) under the control of a shared 3-dimensional chromatin structure.

First, this statistically significant enrichment provides partial validation of our MTAG results. Second, genes with known mutations of large effect, when combined with our data demonstrating SNPs with smaller regulatory effects on the same phenotype (cognition), can be considered an \"allelic series\" - a natural set of experiments powerfully demonstrating directional information (in the form of a dose-response curve) regarding gene function. Such information can be leveraged for the identification of novel drug targets. Third, converging evidence across the Mendelian and GWAS lists can aid interpretation of specific pathways and molecular processes that are necessary to normal neuronal function, and vice versa. For example, two genes on both the Mendelian and GWAS lists (GMPPB and LARGE) are associated with dystroglycanopathies with mental retardation. This information provides context for the observation that DAG1, which encodes dystroglycan 1, is the strongest TWAS result in the hippocampus.

Our drug set enrichment analysis pointed to several potential nootropic mechanisms. Most notably, the strongest signal was for cinnarizine, a T-type calcium channel inhibitor typically prescribed for seasickness. In the present study, we discovered an association of cognition to CACNA1I, which encodes one component of the voltage-dependent T-Type Cav3.3 channel, and has been previously associated with schizophrenia. While cinnarizine has strong antihistamine activity and may be inappropriate for general cognitive enhancement, a novel agent targeting Cav3.3 has shown nootropic activity in preclinical models. In addition to gene set results suggesting a potential role for calcium and potassium channel regulation, single-gene results also point towards a potential role for the metabotropic glutamate receptor encoded by GRM3. This gene is also implicated in schizophrenia, and drugs targeting GRM3 have been suggested as a potential treatment however, a large-scale trial of one such agent was unsuccessful in treating psychotic symptoms. Based on the present results, future studies may seek to examine a role for such compounds in cognitive remediation. It is also noteworthy that the present study identified genome-wide significant evidence implicating three phosphodiesterase genes: PDE1C, PDE2A, and PDE4D. In particular, there is growing interest in PDE2A inhibitors as potential agents for cognitive enhancement, and evidence suggests that these agents may enhance synaptic plasticity via presynaptic modulation of cAMP hydrolysis.
