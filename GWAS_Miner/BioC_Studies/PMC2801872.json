Collagen type 4 is the major structural component of basement membranes, suggesting that previously unrecognized cell-matrix interactions may exert an important role in regulating arterial stiffness. Further work is needed to elucidate these mechanisms, and this could potentially lead to the development of novel interventions aimed at delaying or preventing the risks associated with accelerated arterial stiffening. This would help fulfill, in part, the high expectations for breakthroughs in basic science and in clinical medicine that are engendered by modern era genetics.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 23144, "infons": {"section_type": "SUPPL", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "Supplementary Material", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 23167, "infons": {"section_type": "FIG", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "Figures and Tables", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 23186, "infons": {"file": "nihms126588f1.jpg", "id": "F1", "section_type": "FIG", "type": "fig_caption"}, "text": "The relationship of pulse wave velocity (PWV) and age in men and women in the SardiNIA study cohort who were genotyped with the 500K/10K Gene Array Set.
