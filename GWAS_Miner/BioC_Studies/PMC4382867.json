MGST1L1 is coexpressed and functionally coupled to prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2 (PTGS2/COX-2), and the combined activity of MGST1L1 and COX-2 increases production of proinflammatory prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), which promotes carcinogenesis through several mechanisms, including stimulation of WNT signaling, an essential oncogenic pathway of colorectal cancer. An in vitro experiment has demonstrated that NSAIDs can inhibit expression of MGST1L1 and COX-2, thereby blocking COX-2 mediated synthesis of PGE2 in human colon carcinoma cells. Taken together, both MGST1L1 and the closely related gene MGST1 may influence NSAID-mediated inhibition of colorectal carcinogenesis partially through involvement in the PGE2-induced WNT signaling pathway. This finding is consistent with strong biologic evidence linking genes in WNT signaling, aspirin and/or NSAIDs, and colorectal cancer.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 19789, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Another candidate gene in this region is LIM domain only 3 (LMO3), a known oncogene located about 686 kb upstream from rs2965667 (Supplementary Figure 3).

The protein encoded by PIK3C2G gene belongs to the phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphonate 3-kinase (PI3K) family, which plays a critical role in cancer. Experimental evidence suggests that activation of PI3K signaling enhances COX-2/PGE2 production that results in inhibition of apoptosis in colon cancer cell lines that can be restored with NSAID-mediated blockade of PI3K. Moreover, our previous study found that regular use of aspirin after diagnosis was associated with longer survival among the 15-30% of colorectal cancer patients with a mutation in PIK3CA, one of the PI3K family genes. Markedly improved survival associated with aspirin according to PIK3CA status was also found in an analysis within a separate clinical trial cohort. Further investigations for the joint effect of these genes would be helpful to better understand the underlying molecular mechanisms of aspirin/NSAIDs and colorectal cancer.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 21145, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "In the case-only interaction analysis, another SNP rs16973225 at chromosome 15q25.2 was identified with genome-wide significant association. This SNP is about 625 kb upstream of interleukin16 (IL16) (Supplementary Figure 4). As a multifunctional cytokine, IL16 plays a critical role in pro-inflammatory processes, including inflammatory bowel disease, Clostridium difficile-associated colitis, and many cancers including colorectal. Moreover, IL16 may stimulate monocyte induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines associated with tumorigenesis, including IL6 and TNF (tumor necrosis factor-alpha), induction of COX-2 expression, and activation of WNT signaling. This evidence suggests the possibility that polymorphisms in or near IL16 gene may regulate the production of inflammatory cytokines that modify the chemopreventive effect of aspirin and/or NSAIDs on colorectal cancer. It is plausible that those GWAS-identified promising loci outside of known coding regions affect more distant genes rather than the closest gene since GWAS loci may be enhancers that can influence gene expression over several hundred kilobases.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 22268, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Our study has several strengths.

The forest plots (Figure 1) show the consistency of the association between aspirin and/or NSAID use and colorectal cancer on a per-study level and the pooled risk estimate (i.e., OR) is remarkably similar to prior studies. Thus, bias due to heterogeneity in the definition and time period of exposure is likely to be minimal. Second, we acknowledge that SNP rs2965667 and the highly correlated rs10505806 are relatively rare and imputed in all studies. However, we directly genotyped rs10505806 in cases and controls within two cohorts included in our study population.
