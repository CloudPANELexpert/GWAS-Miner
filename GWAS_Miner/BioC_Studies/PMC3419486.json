Most importantly, this unique population allowed us to find additional candidate loci, particularly in the CTNNA2 region in which we saw strong evidence for both linkage and association. The role of CTNNA2 in the brain also makes this gene a promising candidate. The CTNNA2 region, in addition to other potential risk regions, needs to be more closely examined to identify the underlying responsible variants and their functional consequences.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 23482, "infons": {"section_type": "SUPPL", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "Supplementary Material", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 23505, "infons": {"section_type": "SUPPL", "type": "footnote"}, "text": "The authors have no conflict of interest to declare.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 23558, "infons": {"section_type": "SUPPL", "type": "footnote"}, "text": "SUPPORTING INFORMATION", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 23581, "infons": {"section_type": "SUPPL", "type": "footnote"}, "text": "Additional supporting information may be found in the online version of this article:", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 23667, "infons": {"section_type": "SUPPL", "type": "footnote"}, "text": "Table S1 Most significant genome-wide association results, stratified.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 23738, "infons": {"section_type": "SUPPL", "type": "footnote"}, "text": "As a service to our authors and readers, this journal provides supporting information supplied by the authors.
