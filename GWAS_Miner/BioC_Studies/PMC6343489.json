Asthma is emblematic of a truly complex disease that develops through the interaction of multiple genetic and environmental factors. The advent of technical and statistical methods for comprehensive genome-wide association studies (GWAS) has helped to identify new loci associated with asthma. The first such study for asthma identified common regulatory variants at and near the ORMDL3/GSDML loci on chromosome 17q21 that were associated with asthma in three populations of European ancestry. These associations have been confirmed in many follow-up replications studies, with the ORMDL3/GSDML representing one of the most consistent asthma associations reported to date. A second asthma GWAS identified common intronic variants in phosphodiesterase 4D (PDE4D) to be strongly associated with asthma in Caucasian children and in four of five additional cohorts of diverse ethnicity. A common variant, rs2378383, on chromosome 9q21.31, near transducin-like enhancer of split 4 (TLE4), was associated with childhood asthma in two Mexican cohorts, but not in Caucasians. A GWAS study performed in two independent populations of African ancestry identified three variants associated with asthma in both populations: rs10515807, mapping to alpha-1B-adrenergic receptor (ADRA1B), rs6052761 near prion-related protein (PRNP) and rs1435879 near dipeptidyl peptidase 10 (DPP10), although replication for these associations was not observed in either four additional populations of African descent or three populations of European descent. Other recent asthma GWAS identified other potential asthma variants, RAD50-IL13 and DENND1B, on chromosome 1q31.3. The GABRIEL project, the largest asthma GWAS to date, consisting of 10 365 asthma cases and 16 110 control individuals, identified genome-wide significant associations between asthma and SNPs in or near IL1RL1/IL18R1, IL33, SMAD3 and IL2RB. The strongest finding was at rs9273349 in the HLADQ region of chromosome 6p21.3. Prior to this, the HLA region had been identified in several genetic studies as a region associated with asthma and related phenotypes. Furthermore, the EVE consortium, a US consortium of similar size to GABRIEL, validated several previously associated regions including loci on 17q21 and genetic variants within the HLA-DQ region.

In addition, adult asthmatics may represent a more severe group of individuals, as many of the milder asthmatic cases resolve by adulthood. In this analysis, we evaluated both the stratified and combined genetic analyses of asthma based on age in an effort to consider the time-dependent nature of asthma. We found that the rs9273349 association finding is notably stronger in the adult asthma cohorts compared to the childhood cohorts. Although the effect of rs9273349 is not completely absent in the childhood cohorts, this association would not have been identified had the childhood cohorts only been evaluated. This suggests that either the childhood cohorts by themselves are underpowered or that age-dependent genetic effects exist for asthma. We selected SNPs for replication based on the combined genetic analysis results to maximize statistical power by utilizing the maximum sample size possible. Further research should be conducted to scrutinize the potential age-dependent genetic effects both in the childhood and adult asthmatic samples by selecting replication SNPs for each sample individually.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 24408, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The SHARP population is complex because it is made up of several clinical trials. While CAMP is one large trial, CARE and ACRN are comprised of multiple clinical trials. As such, the ascertainment criteria vary throughout SHARP. Some include adults (ACRN) while others include children (CAMP, CARE). Although inclusion criteria varies among the SHARP studies, doctor's diagnosis of asthma, which is considered the gold standard for asthma diagnosis, is the minimum criterion used. Therefore, although the various clinical trials included in SHARP are heterogeneous in nature, the gold standard for asthma diagnosis is consistently used at a minimum for asthma diagnosis. It is also important to consider how the incorporation of control individuals from the general population affect the analysis results. The control individuals we selected will have asthma at the rate that is observed in the general population (roughly 5%), which will lead to misclassification and hence decreases the overall power of our analysis. The initial manuscript that discusses the analytic method proposed here, evaluated the effect of using unselected controls on the overall power of the analysis and although this reduces the overall power of the analysis, it does not bias the results.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 25681, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "In summary, this GWAS identifies a novel sequence variant that is primarily associated with asthma in adults, although there is evidence to suggest that this association also exists among children.
