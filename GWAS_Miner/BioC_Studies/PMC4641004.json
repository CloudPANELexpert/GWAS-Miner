However, there has been no study evaluating a genetic influence on BMA induced by OCS bursts in children with asthma. In the present study, we identified two SNPs of potential functional significance (rs9896933 and rs2074439) that were involved in the gamma tubulin pathway and had significant interactive effects with a cumulative dose of OCS on BMA in children with asthma.

Decreased bone formation is an important mechanism for corticosteroid-induced BMD loss. Therefore, corticosteroid effects on the osteoblast have been extensively evaluated. Corticosteroids prevent terminal osteoblast differentiation, induces osteoblast apoptosis, and inhibits osteoblast production of bone matrix. While these effects are known, the role of microtubules on corticosteroid-induced BMD loss in the osteoblast cells has been not previously elucidated. Microtubules are major components of the cytoskeleton and provide scaffolding, sequestering, and delivery functions. It is known that microtubules are involved in various signaling pathways, such as sonic hedgehog/Gli, Wnt/beta-catenin, G-protein, and mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways which are related to skeletal development and homeostasis. Interestingly, recent reports noted that inhibition of microtubule assembly increases osteoblast differentiation in vitro, and murine bone mass in vivo. Formation of new microtubule polymers from heterodimers of alpha and beta tubulin is termed 'nucleation' and requires another member of the tubulin family, gamma tubulin. gamma tubulin forms gamma tubulin ring complexes with additional proteins and these gamma tubulin complexes may also be involved in regulating microtubule dynamics. Tubulin folding cofactor D coded by TBCD is one of the five tubulin-specific cochaperones A-E that mediate the nucleation of tubulin. Tubulin folding cofactor D plays a critical role in recruiting gamma tubulin ring complexes and initiating microtubule growth and excess of tubulin folding cofactor D inhibits microtubule assembly. Taken together, it is possible that a disruption in the gamma tubulin pathway in the osteoblast cells may result in BMD changes and these changes may be modified via genetic factors. Interestingly, androgen was reported to promote gamma tubulin recruitment and microtubule assembly in human fibroblast and pregnenolone was reported to bind to microtubule-associated protein 2 and to stimulate microtubule assembly. As mentioned before, inhibition of microtubule assembly in osteoblast is possibly linked to BMD decrease. Therefore, it is also possible that corticosteroid-induced BMD loss is associated with the gamma tubulin pathway.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 17402, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "An eQTL is a locus that explains a fraction of the genetic variance of a gene expression phenotype and standard eQTL analysis is particularly useful for identifying pharmacogenomic loci. However, eQTL may differ according to the cell type and thus functional validation using eQTL is optimally conducted in cell lines that are relevant to the disease. We demonstrated an epistasis between cis-eQTL SNP of TUBG1 and the second-most-significant SNP in GWAS which is in tight LD with a possibly functional non-synonymous coding SNP in TBCD. A biologic interaction between gamma tubulin and tubulin folding cofactor D was reported, and we found that TBCD and TUBG1 shared a common pathway using the program GeneMania (http://genemania.org/) (Figure 1C). Combined, these findings suggest that two SNPs identified in the present study may have a causative role in OCS-induced BMA in children with asthma. We believed that children with asthma were a relevant population to reveal genetic factors associated BMA caused by corticosteroids, because they carry little risk for BMD loss compared to the elderly or to patients with other diseases. However, we could not obtain BMA data from a similar group of asthmatic children for the replication of our results, which is an important limitation in generalizing our results. Confirmation in an independent cohort is warranted. In addition, considering that only 3 SNPs out of 2,000 identified in the GWAS showed cis-regulatory effects, different pharmacologic profiles between dexamethasone and prednisone need to be mentioned.

The protein encoded by APPL1 gene has been shown to be involved in the regulation of cell proliferation, and in the crosstalk between the adiponectin and insulin signaling pathways.
