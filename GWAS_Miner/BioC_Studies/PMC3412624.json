The most significant SNP in this study is rs763780 in IL17F, a base substitution that alters the histidine to arginine at amino acid 161 (H161R). In vitro functional experiments demonstrated that, in contrast to the wild-type 161H interleukin-17F, the 161R variant form lacks the ability to activate the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway, thereby restricting cytokine and chemokine production. Wild-type 161H interleukin-17F has also demonstrated a strong anti-angiogenesis effect by markedly inhibiting the angiogenesis of human endothelial cells and inducing them to produce interleukin-2, TGF-beta, and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1. A recent study has also shown the anti-angiogenetic and anti-tumor properties of wild-type interleukin-17F in vivo. With respect to these activities, the variant 161R form of interleukin-17F is a natural antagonist of the anti-angiogenic and pro-inflammatory effects of wild-type 161H interleukin-17F. For example, the 161R variant has been associated with protective effects in Asian patients with inflammatory and autoimmune conditions. The resulting pro-angiogenic effects of the variant 161R of interleukin-17F could be further magnified by the concomitant increased expression driven by the noncoding rs7771466 IL17F variant.
