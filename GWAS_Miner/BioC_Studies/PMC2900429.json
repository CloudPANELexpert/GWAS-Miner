Here we explore the relation between 448,293 single nucleotide polymorphisms in each of 31,622 voxels of the entire brain across 740 elderly subjects (mean age+-s.d.: 75.52+-6.82 years; 438 male) including subjects with Alzheimer's disease, Mild Cognitive Impairment, and healthy elderly controls from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). We used tensor-based morphometry to measure individual differences in brain structure at the voxel level relative to a study-specific template based on healthy elderly subjects. We then conducted a genome-wide association at each voxel to identify genetic variants of interest. By studying only the most associated variant at each voxel, we developed a novel method to address the multiple comparisons problem and computational burden associated with the unprecedented amount of data. No variant survived the strict significance criterion, but several genes worthy of further exploration were identified, including CSMD2 and CADPS2. These genes have high relevance to brain structure.

There is a certain amount of spatial clustering because all voxels are not independent so some spatial clustering is expected even if the null hypothesis were true. To get an approximation of how much spatial clustering is expected by chance, Fig. 5 shows the minimum P-values in each voxel after the genomes have been randomly assigned to each subject. A certain amount of clumping is expected when top SNP maps are made from null data. One source of spatial coherence in these maps is that they are based on smooth maps of volumetric differences computed using tensor-based morphometry, which uses nonlinear image registration of each subject's imaging data to a template. These methods generate spatially smooth maps of volume differences, where the level of smoothness is dependent on the form of the regularizer (Laplacian, elastic, fluid, etc.) and also on the spatial resolution of the numerical grid used to solve the differential equations whose solution is the deformation field. In our approach, the elastic regularizer is decomposed into its eigenfunctions so that the warping fields can be computed using a Fast Fourier transform. Because these deformation fields are smooth, so are averages and differences of their Jacobian (gradient) maps, and so are the resulting statistical maps. In the future, it may be interesting to see if there is more latent structure or anatomical coherence in the top SNP maps than would be otherwise expected if the data were completely null.

It is worth considering whether such a localization may be due to a bias (differential sensitivity) that might arise from the method of image warping followed by using the warp's Jacobian determinant as the dependent variable. If statistical maps based on deformation fields tended to detect effects more frequently at edges than in the rest of the brain, then this would be a possible source of bias, but it appears not to be the case in other empirical studies using TBM (in fact the opposite tends to be the case). Most studies with deformation morphometry tend to show the greatest effect sizes throughout large homogeneous regions, and notably our TBM studies of Alzheimer's disease find greatest effects in broad regions of the brain's white matter, or throughout the lateral ventricles, both at 1.5 T and 3T, and in large samples. Also, statistical effects are not preferentially detected at edges in images when the effects of single candidate genes on the brain are assessed with TBM. Although the deformation is driven by a body force (image gradient, or variational derivative of a cost function) that is generally greatest at the edges of structures in the images, the interiors of structures still tend to be better registered than their boundaries once all the data are aligned. In the interiors of structures, coherent patterns (such as atrophy) are more likely to be reinforced across all members of a group than at boundary voxels that may be less well registered across all subjects in the group, even after nonlinear registration. After all, the registration algorithm focuses on improving the alignment of edges as they are always the least well registered parts of the image, and therefore these regions are likely to show low effect sizes in a population study. Even so, some warping methods use regularizers that are designed to make the Jacobian determinant as uniform as possible in regions of homogeneous image intensity (e.g., the sKL-MI method, see), so the Jacobian determinant will change the most at an image edge. If this is true, and if the \"top SNP\" is a different SNP for different structures, then it is more likely that the top SNP in a vGWAS map will change at the boundary of a structure. This is speculative, and the spatial coherence of top-SNP maps may depend on the sample size, the true spatial correlation in the \"top SNP\" maps in an arbitrarily large sample, as well as the methods (maximum statistic vs. cluster size statistic) used to detect them.
