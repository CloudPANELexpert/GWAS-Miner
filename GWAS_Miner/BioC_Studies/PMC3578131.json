Our analyses have identified a novel, statistically significant relationship between the change in circulating adiponectin following a three-week fenofibrate treatment and the rs2384207 variant, located in a linkage disequilibrium block in the 12q24 region. This GWAS adds to the body of evidence linking that genomic region with several metabolic phenotypes, specifically susceptibility to type 2 and autoimmune type 1 diabetes, abdominal adiposity and possibly circulating leptin levels. Furthermore, a recent meta-analysis of GWAS found robust associations of several SNPs in the 12q24.31 region and several metabolic traits including adiponectin. The signal in our study was observed in 12q24.13, a region spanning several genes including DDX54, TPCN1, SLC24A6, and OAS1/OAS2/OAS3. DDX54 encodes an RNA helicase that has been shown to contribute to differentiation and myelination of oligodendrocytes while TPCN1 and SLC24A6 encode proteins implicated in calcium signaling. Of utmost biological relevance, however, are the neighboring OAS1/OAS2/OAS3 genes, which code for enzymes involved in innate immunity and could thus mediate the adiponectin/toll-like receptor 4 signaling pathway. However, previous studies reported evidence of long-range linkage disequilibrium between variants in the OAS cluster and type 1 diabetes susceptibility genes in a European population; it is possible that the linkage disequilibrium structure of 12q24.13 also has implications for our findings.

Third, we saw suggestive associations with markers in the SCUBE1 and TMEM18 genes, which have been implicated in cardiovascular disease pathogenesis and obesity, respectively.

On the other hand, in vitro studies showed that adiponectin inhibits EGFR phosphorylation, heparin-binding EGF-stimulated protein synthesis, and heparin-binding EGF shedding, suggesting bidirectional cross-talk between adiponectin and EGFR signaling.

First, the GOLDN trial measured total rather than high molecular weight (HMW) adiponectin levels, which may represent the biologically active form of the protein. Nevertheless, prior reports have shown that measuring HMW adiponectin does not confer additional information over total adiponectin in studies of chronic disease, perhaps due to the high correlation between the phenotypes. Second, although our baseline findings are consistent with other genome-wide studies, the fenofibrate response results have not been replicated. This challenge is common to pharmacogenetic studies, as very few cohorts are comparable on both drug intervention design, genotyping approach, and phenotype ascertainment. Furthermore, the Q-Q plots suggest slight genomic inflation (lambda=1.07 for the fenofibrate response models), exacerbating the need for independent replication of our findings. As such, these results are to be considered preliminary, but informative of future studies of fenofibrate pharmacogenetics. Third, the homogeneity of our study population limits the generalizability of these findings, prompting the need for investigating genetic determinants of fenofibrate response in ethnically diverse samples in future studies. Fourth, the VEGAS gene-based test only estimates an empirical P-value without giving information on the direction of the observed association, and it is likely that the overall effect of a gene on a trait is determined by its constituent SNPs, some of which may have opposing effects. In light of this limitation, it is important to interpret our findings in context of all three statistical approaches, namely the single marker, gene-based, and biological pathway analyses. Finally, the presented results appear to be inconsistent with the moderate to high estimates of heritability of adiponectin response to fenofibrate. One possible explanation lies in the GWAS method itself, as it excludes such sources of \"missing heritability\" as rare functional variants, epigenetic traits, or gene-gene interactions. Another possibility, however, is that the estimate of heritability is too high as it erroneously includes variance due to shared environment, which could not be ascertained in the GOLDN study because household information was not available.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 22627, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "In conclusion, we have found preliminary evidence for association for several biologically relevant genetic loci with changes in plasma adiponectin following fenofibrate therapy.
