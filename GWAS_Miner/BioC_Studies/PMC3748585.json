NAT8 is a biologically compelling candidate for the observed association. NAT8 is a member of the GCN5-related N-acetyltransferase (GNAT) superfamily, a group of enzymes that catalyze transfer of an acetyl group from acetyl-coenzyme A to a wide range of acceptor substrates. NAT8 is strongly, and almost exclusively, expressed in kidney (Supplementary Figure 3), in particular by tubular cells of the renal cortex (Supplementary Figures 4 and 5).

SNP rs10206899 is in high LD (r2=1.0) with the only common non-synonymous SNP in NAT8, rs15358 (A595G). SNP rs15358 gives rise to a non-conservative amino acid change (F143S) within the acetyl-coenzyme A binding site an effect predicted to influence acetylation by NAT8 (Supplementary Figure 6).
