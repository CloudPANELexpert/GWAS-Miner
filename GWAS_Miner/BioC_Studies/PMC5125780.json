After removing SNPs showing departures from Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium (P<0.001), 198,345 SNPs remained.

A one degree-of-freedom (1df) likelihood ratio test of the interaction effect was performed by comparing the models with and without the interaction term. While 735,843 SNPs were analyzed, multiple testing correction for 735,843 SNPs would be highly conservative, due to the extensive linkage disequilibrium (LD) between SNPs. In particular, among the total analyzed SNPs, 149,817 were genotyped, and the remaining SNPs were imputed based on their LD with the observed SNPs and are thus not independent.

To evaluate evidence for GE interactions at the gene level, we applied Principal Component (PC) Analysis to the SNP data, and then tested for PC-pesticide interactions using conditional logistic regression. PC analysis is a dimension reduction technique that has been shown to be a powerful approach for gene-level association tests; here we adapted the approach of Gauderman et al. to study GE interactions in a sample of discordant siblings. SNPs were first assigned to genes if they mapped within 20 kb upstream or downstream of a gene. By this mapping rule, a total of 454,993 SNPs were mapped to 23,765 genes (with the number of SNPs mapping to a gene ranging from 1 to 1,204, median=11, interquartile range=25). We then considered two ways of evaluating GE interactions at the gene-level. First, we used the first PC for each gene (PC1), which captures the most genetic variation across that gene, to represent the genetic variation in the gene, and tested the effect of the interaction between PC1 and pesticide use on risk of PD; i.e. we performed a 1df test of the PC1*pesticide interaction term based on conditional logistic regression models. We also considered the first k PCs for each gene that in total explain at least 80 % of the variance in the genotypes for that gene, performed k PC-pesticide interaction tests for the gene, and then combined the k P-values using Fisher's p-value combination method providing a global test of PC-pesticide interaction. We refer to these two approaches as the \"PC1\" gene-level test and the \"All-PC\" gene-level test. We note that alternative approaches could have been used, for instance the All-PC test could have been performed using a joint likelihood ratio test of all the PC-pesticide interaction terms. However, this test poses challenges for large genes, where many PCs are required to represent the genetic variation in the gene, leading to a very high degree-of-freedom test. We therefore selected the approach described above based on combining individual PC-pesticide interaction p-values using Fisher's methods. Post-hoc sensitivity analyses demonstrated that for the top gene-level results presented in the paper, these two alternative approaches provided very similar results. For the gene-level analyses, the number of tests is equal to the total number of genes analyzed; thus, because 23,765 genes were analyzed, the threshold for genome-wide significance was 0.05/23765 = 2.1e-06.

In an in vitro experiment, ERCC6L2 had characteristics of an early DNA damage-response protein that traffics to the mitochondria and the nucleus in a reactive oxygen species-dependent fashion.

Furthermore, the sample size analyzed in this study is small, particularly for investigating GE interactions at the genome-wide level. However, the discordant sib-pair study design that was used generally provides greater power to detect GE interactions than the population based case-control design, and thus smaller case-sib samples are required to achieve similar power to detect GE interactions. Moreover, powerful statistical methods based on gene-level rather than SNP-level tests of GE interaction effects were applied, providing suggestive evidence of GE effects that warrant further investigation. While the gene-level analyses have the advantage of potentially increasing the power of association analysis, they also have limitations. In particular, interpretation of the results is not as straightforward as in standard SNP-environment interaction analyses; thus, while a test may provide statistical evidence that the effect of variation in a gene on risk of disease is modified by the environment, the effect sizes are not readily interpretable.
