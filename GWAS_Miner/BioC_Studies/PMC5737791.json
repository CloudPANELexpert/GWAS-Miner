The aim of the current study was to identify genetic associations with inhibitory control using the stop signal task in a large sample (n=934) of healthy young adults of European ancestry. We genotyped the subjects genome-wide and then used a hierarchical approach in which we tested: 1) 7 a priori single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) previously associated with stop signal task performance; 2) ~9,000 SNPs designated as high-value addiction (HVA) markers by the SmokeScreen  array; and 3) ~5M genotyped and imputed SNPs, followed by a gene-based association analysis utilizing the resultant p-values. A priori SNP analyses revealed nominally significant associations between response inhibition and one locus in HTR2A (rs6313; p = 0.04, dominance model, uncorrected) in the same direction as prior findings. A nominally significant association was also found in one locus in ANKK1 (rs1800497; p = 0.03, uncorrected), although this was in the opposite direction of previous reports. After accounting for multiple comparisons, the HVA, genome-wide, and gene-based analyses yielded no significant findings. This study implicates variation in serotonergic and dopaminergic genes, but also underscores the difficulty of detecting the influence of individual SNPs, even when biological information is used to prioritize testing. While such small effect sizes suggest limited utility of individual SNPs in predicting risk for addiction or other impulse control disorders, they may nonetheless shed light on complex biological processes underlying poor inhibitory control.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 1811, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "Introduction", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 1824, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Poor inhibitory control, defined broadly as an impaired ability to inhibit maladaptive or inappropriate behavior, is a well-established risk factor for substance abuse. Longitudinal studies indicate that children who exhibit high levels of disinhibited behavior are more likely to use drugs as adolescents, and in laboratory animals, poor inhibitory control is a predictor of rapid acquisition, escalation and dysregulation of drug self-administration. Associations between poor inhibitory control and risk for abuse have been observed across a number of drug classes, including alcohol, stimulants, and cannabis (; although perhaps less so for opiate drugs:). As such, there is a strong interest in determining the neurobiological factors, including genetic influences, underlying deficits in inhibition. Twin studies indicate that inhibitory control is heritable (31% - 50%), yet the specific genetic influences on inhibitory control are not yet known. Identifying genes that contribute to poor inhibition might help to identify individuals at risk for developing drug and alcohol problems and to develop strategies to prevent, diagnose, and treat drug and alcohol abuse. Moreover, the genetic influences on inhibitory control should theoretically be less complex and more easily detectible than genetic influences on the more diffuse and heterogeneous construct of substance abuse, thus making inhibition a useful intermediary construct for understanding genetic influences on risk for substance abuse.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 3332, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Several laboratory measures have been developed to assess inhibitory control in humans, including the stop signal task and the go/no-go task.

Poor inhibitory control is indicated by a greater number of inhibitory failures, or a longer amount of time needed to inhibit the response.

We excluded individuals who were heavy substance users to avoid the potential confound of the deleterious effects of chronic drug use on frontal cognitive function, including inhibition. We employed a hierarchical analytic approach, in which groups of SNPs with higher priority were analyzed in three stratified subsets in order to maximize power to detect associations with response inhibition.

Second, we tested the relationship between response inhibition and high-value addiction (HVA) markers prioritized in the SmokeScreen  array by BioRealm.

We replicated those findings here, showing that in the same dominance model, the minor allele is also associated with better response inhibition in a large sample of healthy young adults. These findings are consistent with preclinical studies demonstrating that serotonin 5-HT2A receptors play an influential role in motor inhibition. For example, 5-HT2A agonists impair and antagonists enhance inhibition, and greater density of cortical 5-HT2A receptors is associated with poorer response inhibition. Importantly, serotonin's role in inhibition has been previously implicated in increased risk for drug abuse. In line with this, the minor allele of rs6313 in HTR2A (identified in this study as predictive of better response inhibition) was associated with less risk for relapse in alcohol dependent individuals, and a recent meta-analysis reported that the minor allele was protective across studies of opioid and alcohol abuse and dependence.

One additional limitation of the accuracy measure used in the present study is that it does not rule out the possible influence of nonspecific performance impairment. Indeed, in the present study the accuracy in inhibiting responses was correlated with both Go reaction time and Go accuracy. It will be important in future studies to include measures that exclude this possibility.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 25896, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Despite our careful assessment of inhibition within a comparatively large sample (n=934) of healthy, non-substance abusing young adults of European ancestry, we did not detect any significant HVA or genome-wide loci after implementing a false discovery rate correction. Although clinical and psychological phenotypes are likely to be highly polygenic, with numerous loci exerting very small effects, we originally expected that our use of response inhibition would be a genetically simpler construct that might be amenable to genome wide significant hits within a relatively smaller sample. By contrast, our findings suggest that this is not the case, and that large samples will be needed for well-characterized behavioral tasks as well. This is consistent with the literature advising collection of much larger samples, perhaps through consortia or other collaborative endeavors, for sufficient power to observe very small magnitude effects at genome-wide significance.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 26868, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "In sum, this study further advances the understanding of genetic variation and behavioral inhibition. Specifically, findings replicated previous associations between variation in the HTR2A and ANKK1 genes and inhibitory control as measured by a stop signal task. The study also highlights the potential for false positives in candidate gene studies, as we failed to replicate 5 of 7 previously reported associations between specific loci and response inhibition on the stop signal task, despite our larger sample size, which should have afforded us greater power compared to the original candidate gene studies. Finally, our findings underscore the difficulty in detecting the influence of individual SNPs from large panels of tests, even when those tests are biologically informed.

To confirm that the measure of inhibitory control used here is comparable to SSRT obtained from the traditional task, we tested a new sample of healthy young adults (n=20) who completed both tasks to compare the outcome measures.
