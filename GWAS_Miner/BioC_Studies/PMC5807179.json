Smoking behaviour and smoking-related morbidity differ by ethnicity. For instance, although African American (AA) smokers on average smoke fewer cigarettes/day than European American (EA) smokers, the level of total nicotine equivalents, a biomarker of total nicotine intake, is similar in AA and EA smokers, suggesting more intensive smoking (e.g., greater puff volume) among AAs. At an equivalent number of cigarettes per day, the risk for lung cancer is higher in AA compared to EA smokers, perhaps due in part to more intensive smoking and, therefore, greater exposure to tobacco-specific nitrosamines and other harmful chemicals. Of note, AA (vs. EA) smokers are also more likely to make quit attempts and are less likely to achieve cessation.

In addition, because CYP2A6 also metabolizes therapeutic drugs including letrozole and tegafur, two chemotherapeutics, as well as other drugs (e.g., efavirenz, metronidazole, artemisinin, valproic acid), the usefulness of CYP2A6 genetics in personalized medicine approaches extends beyond tobacco dependence.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 30729, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Several limitations of our work warrant mention.

In addition, the lack of overlap in signals observed between AA and European descent smokers may be due, in part, to differences in the genotyping platforms used, reference panels for imputation, quality control/imputation/MAF filtering pipelines, as well as potential inter-ethnic variation in environmental confounding factors and/or additional potential differences between smokers seeking treatment versus those that are not. However, head-to-head comparisons of NMR GWAS signals in PNAT2 AA and PNAT2 European descent smokers, analyzed using an identical genotyping platform and phase I release of 1000 Genomes, also indicate a substantial lack overlap (unpublished observations).
