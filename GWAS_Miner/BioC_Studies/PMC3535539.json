It will be important to investigate the genotype-phenotype correlations with this TNIP1 variant as well as other genes in the ubiquitin and NF-kappaB pathways that are likely to contribute to the pathogenesis of autoimmune disorders. Indeed, several additional genes involved in binding to, or enzymatic modification of, ubiquitin have recently shown associations with human autoimmunity in GWAS studies.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 22132, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Previous studies have identified promoter polymorphisms at the nicotinic cholinergic receptor alpha 1 (CHRNA1) locus were specifically associated with very early age of onset (before age 20) of EOMG, and also interacted with AIRE.

Nevertheless, the limited statistical power must have precluded detection of numerous weaker associations. For high-frequency alleles (e.g. 0.4), our study had >80% power to detect loci with modest ORs (1.2) in additive models, whereas, for lower-frequency susceptibility alleles (e.g. 0.1), that could only be achieved where ORs were substantially higher (>1.7).
