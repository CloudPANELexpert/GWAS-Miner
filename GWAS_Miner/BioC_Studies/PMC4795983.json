The genetic and non-genetic architecture of schizophrenia is complex and consequently different approaches including candidate gene studies, GWA studies and gene-environment studies are needed to reveal the pathogenesis of this psychiatric disorder. Although there has been many decades of research on schizophrenia during the modern era of genetics technology, we are still far from fully understanding the complex phenotype of schizophrenia and its genetic background. The majority of genes which have been found to show significant associations with schizophrenia within recent years could not explain much of the variance associated with schizophrenia . Genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity, together with low reliability and long-term stability of clinical diagnoses, could be possible reasons for this. To overcome some of these problems, researchers have focused on GWA studies using endophenotypes. Endophenotypes, also known as intermediate phenotypes, which by definition are heritable and disease-associated, have the advantage of being reliably measurable, stable and continuously distributed (so called \"quantitative traits\"), and are thought to be closer to the underlying genetics than the illness category (e.g., schizophrenia).", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 2942, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "A variety of endophenotypes has been established in psychiatric research.

Potential endophenotypes of schizophrenia have also emerged from neuroimaging, e.g., structural imaging studies. Two examples for neuroimaging endophenotypes are the volume and the thickness of the superior temporal gyrus (STG). The STG includes Heschl's gyrus as well as the planum temporale and is involved in auditory processes, speech, language, communication and social cognition. Both an abnormal decrease of STG gray matter volume and cortical thinning in the STG, particularly in the left hemisphere, can be seen in patients with schizophrenia as well as in first-degree relatives of patients with schizophrenia. Reduced STG volume is also associated with auditory hallucinations, a core positive symptom of schizophrenia. Also, Tang et al. found a negative correlation between gray matter volume in left middle and superior temporal gyrus and PANSS-positive symptoms.

Secondly, our sample was medium-sized and rather heterogeneous; however, we did find supporting evidence for our results in a more homogeneous subsample of individuals of European descent only. Thirdly, the cause of cortical atrophy in the STG is unknown in patients with SCZ and might be due to accidental, etiological or consequential alterations. Whereas there is some evidence for a strong relationship between cerebral glucose metabolism and brain atrophy in healthy volunteers, showed that regional glucose metabolic abnormalities are not the results of atrophy in patients with Alzheimer's disease. Further research is warranted to clarify the relationship between reduced brain metabolism (and utilization of glucose in particular) and an atrophic brain/cortex, especially in patients with SCZ. Fourthly, we could not formally test our interpretations regarding schizophrenia and diabetes, since our sample did not include any diabetes relevant data such as blood insulin levels or fasting glucose levels. However, we found a negative correlation between high body mass index (BMI), which is just as type 2 diabetes one of the metabolic syndrome symptoms, and left STG thickness in patients only (r = -0.214, p = 0.024; in HC: r = -0.135, p = 0.131; the correlation was not driven by patients with a higher cumulative antipsychotic dose). However, to clarify the relationship between diabetes and schizophrenia and to elucidate the function of the insulin signaling pathway in schizophrenia, further studies are warranted. This relationship might also be explained by an unhealthy lifestyle, which is more common in patients with schizophrenia than in controls, and the use of (especially atypical) antipsychotic drugs which promote weight gain and other manifestations of the metabolic syndrome such as impaired fasting glucose levels. Antipsychotic medication can even facilitate the manifestation of type 2 diabetes in patients with schizophrenia. The fact that people with different genetic variants (e.g., alleles with bases \"T\" versus \"G\" for our top hit rs1587409) can respond differentially to environmental variation (e.g. medication) might also account for some of the phenotypical variance (e.g. left superior temporal gyrus thickness). This phenomenon is also called gene-environment interaction. To be clear, if reduced left STG thickness in schizophrenia is due to treatment with medication in patients with certain genetic variants, this would lend support to the hypothesis that the genetic variation alone is not a primary risk factor for schizophrenia but it is rather the gene-environment interaction which leads to the emergence of symptoms and chronicity. However, we did not find a significant interaction between genetic variation and dosage of antipsychotic drugs in our sample. Lastly, medication can confound thickness measures in schizophrenia patients. However, here the dosage of typical or atypical antipsychotic medication that patients were receiving at the time of the scan was not correlated with left STG cortical thickness measures in our sample (ps = 0.947 and 0.426, respectively). This result is consistent with the finding of who showed that current dose of antipsychotic medication does not significantly affect variation in cortical thickness.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 26456, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "title_2"}, "text": "Conclusion", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 26467, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Taken together, we found supporting evidence for a genetic association between left STG thickness, an endophenotype for schizophrenia, and schizophrenia-relevant biochemical pathways such as the insulin signaling pathway.
