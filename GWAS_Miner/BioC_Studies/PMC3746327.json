Although the sample size is relatively small compared with that of the studies in general populations, the current study is the first and largest GWAS of lung function in comprehensively phenotyped subjects with asthma. Further replication in well-phenotyped independent populations is essential to confirm our findings. Three predrug spirometric measures of lung function (ppFEV1, ppFVC, and FEV1/FVC ratio) were studied. FEV1 is the volume of air that can be expired forcibly in 1 second after full inspiration. FVC is the volume of air that can be expired forcibly after full inspiration. The FEV1/FVC ratio is the ratio of FEV1 to FVC. Both FEV1 and FVC values can be decreased in patients with respiratory diseases but might not be in the same proportion. These 3 measures are correlated but might reflect fine differences in lung function. The FEV1/FVC ratio and FEV1 reflect airway obstruction and the grade of airway obstruction and thus are used together to define chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. ppFEV1 was the primary phenotype in this study because it is highly correlated with asthma severity and mostly used for clinical studies in asthmatic subjects. Although no SNP reached genome-wide significance (P = 5 x 10-8), multiple SNPs were suggestively associated with ppFEV1, ppFVC, or FEV1/FVC ratio values (P < 10-4, see Tables E2, E4, and E5). In general, the results for these 3 measurements agreed well, although the top SNPs were not always the same in the 3 measurements (see Table E2). More importantly, multiple top SNPs belong to the same pathway and are functionally related to lung function. The same effect direction of these SNPs in all 4 studied populations further supports our results. Although a single SNP with a modest P value does not meet the strict requirements for association in a GWAS analysis, multiple independent loci mapped to the same biological pathway are very unlikely to be a result of chance, and thus pathway analysis is an important complementary approach to a GWAS.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 16993, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "For example, 4 of 32 loci associated with ppFEV1 values are TH1 or IL-12 cytokine family pathway genes: IL12A, IL12RB1, STAT4, and IRF2 (Table I).

In the well-phenotyped SARP population genetic scores of these 4 SNPs were inversely associated with ppFEV1 values (P = 2 x 10-7) and positively associated with the ATS asthma severity classification (P = .005). The risk allele of IL12RB1, STAT4, and IRF2 is its major allele, and the risk allele of IL12A is its minor allele. In general, the combinations of risk alleles involving IRF2 were correlated with higher ppFEV1 values, and those including IL12A were associated with lower ppFEV1 values (see Table E10 in this article's Online Repository at www.jacionline.org). IL-12 is a key cytokine that modulates innate and adaptive immune responses. IL-12 is a heterodimer composed of the p35 subunit (encoded by IL12A) and the p40 subunit (encoded by IL12B). The coexpression and dimerization of the IL-12RB1 and IL-12RB2 proteins led to the formation of the high-affinity IL-12 receptor. The main role of IL-12 is to activate IFN-gamma (IFNG) production. The response of lymphocytes to IL-12 is mediated by STAT4, which induces the expression of IL-12RB2 and IRF1. IRF1 is a transcription activator of the genes induced by IFN-alpha (IFNA1), IFN-beta (IFNB1), and IFNG, whereas IRF2 competitively inhibits the expression of genes activated by IRF1. The IL-12-STAT4-IFNG signaling pathway is essential for the differentiation of naive TH cells into TH1 cells. GWASs in patients with autoimmune diseases have consistently identified IL-12-STAT4-IFNG signaling pathway genes.

In a study of acute asthma exacerbations in children, the expression of TH1 pathways genes is decreased during exacerbation, with deficits in baseline lung function. Rhinovirus-induced clinical phenotypes are more severe in asthmatic subjects than healthy control subjects and indicate impaired TH1 or augmented TH2 immune responses.
