The gene product of TRAF3IP2 is a positive signaling adaptor required for IL-17-mediated T-cell immune responses. The TRAF3IP2 protein interacts with tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor (TRAF) proteins and either I-kappaB kinase or mitogen-activated protein kinase to activate either NF-kappaB or Jun kinase. Upon recruitment to CD40 and the BAFF receptor in B-cells, TRAF3IP2 also negatively regulates B-cell survival through its interaction with TRAF3. The negative regulation of CD40-BAFF-mediated B cell functions results in 'hyper-T cell-dependent' and T cell-independent immune responses in TRAF3IP2-deficient mice. Researchers in a previous study also found that TRAF3IP2 is a key component of IL-17-mediated signaling and that IL-17-mediated gene expression is completely abolished in TRAF3IP2-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts. In addition, epithelial cells could be identified as the critical cell type in which TRAF3IP2 mediates IL-17-dependent inflammatory disease. In PsV, a subset of T-cells expressing IL-17 plays a major role. The IL-17 expressing T-cells that are abundant in the epidermis of psoriatic lesions but which are absent in healthy donor epidermis are CD8+ cells, whereas in lesional psoriatic dermis, mainly IL-17 expressing CD4+ (but also CD8+) T-cells are strongly increased relative to healthy skin. Epidermal hyperplasia and the production of innate immune peptides such as human beta-defensin 2 (hBD-2) are associated with these IL-17+ T-cells. The crucial role of IL-17 is also supported by the observation that in psoriasis treatment response to TNF inhibitors correlates with suppressed IL-17 signaling. Moreover, we showed that in immortalized N-TERT keratinocytes (N-TERT KCs) and in normal human keratinocytes (NHKs) IL-17A and TNF-alpha together induce the expression of DEFB4 (encoding hBD-2) which is absent in N-TERT KCs and NHKs with silenced TRAF3IP2 (see Supplementary Fig. 5). In epithelial cells, the binding of IL-17A and/or IL-17F to the heterodimeric IL-17R leads to the recruitment of TRAF3IP2 through homotypic interactions between conserved (SEFIR) domains. This allows the incorporation of TRAF6 into the signaling complex and then downstream activation of the NF-kappaB and mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways. We thus speculate that a dysregulation of TRAF3IP2 might have a major impact on IL-17 signaling and, hence, on the activation of NFkappaB-pathways, leading to the upregulation of pro-inflammatory factors.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 15063, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "For the TRAF3IP2 locus newly identified here, fine mapping and resequencing efforts together with extensive functional studies are required to detect all potential causal variants and thus to specify the contribution of the locus to overall disease susceptibility.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 15328, "infons": {"section_type": "METHODS", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "Online Methods", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 15343, "infons": {"section_type": "METHODS", "type": "title_2"}, "text": "Recruitment of patients and healthy controls", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 15388, "infons": {"section_type": "METHODS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Samples were organized in panels that corresponded to the successive steps of the present study.
