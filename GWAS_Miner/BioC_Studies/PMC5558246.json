The French GWAS comprised 1,495 patients with glioma who were ascertained through the Service de Neurologie Mazarin, Groupe Hospitalier Pitie-Salpetriere Paris. The controls (n = 1,213) were ascertained from the SU.VI.MAX (Supplementation en Vitamines et MinerauxAntioXydants) study of 12,735 healthy subjects (women aged 35-60 years; men aged 45-60 years). The German GWAS comprised 880 patients who had undergone surgery for a glioma at the Department of Neurosurgery, University of Bonn Medical Center, between 1996 and 2008. Control subjects were taken from three population studies: KORA (Co-operative Health Research in the Region of Augsburg; n = 488); POPGEN (Population Genetic Cohort; n = 678) and the Heinz Nixdorf Recall study (n = 380). Standard quality-control measures were applied to the UK, French and German GWAS and have previously been reported. The MDA GWAS was based on 1,281 cases (786 males; mean age 47 years) who were ascertained through the MD Anderson Cancer Center, Texas, between 1990 and 2008. Individuals from the Cancer Genetic Markers of Susceptibility (CGEMS, n = 2,245) studies served as controls. Quality-control measures were applied as per the primary GWAS. The UCSF adult glioma case-control study (SFAGS-GWAS) included participants of the San Francisco Bay Area Adult Glioma Study (AGS). Details of subject recruitment for AGS have been reported previously. Briefly, cases were adults (>18 years of age) with newly diagnosed, histologically confirmed glioma. Population-based cases who were diagnosed between 1991 and 2009 (series 1-4) and who were residing in the six San Francisco Bay area counties were ascertained using the Cancer Prevention Institute of California's early-case ascertainment system. Clinic-based cases who were diagnosed between 2002 and 2012 (series 3-5) were recruited from the UCSF Neuro-oncology Clinic, regardless of the place of residence. From 1991 to 2010, population-based controls from the same residential area as the population-based cases were identified using random digit-dialing and were frequency matched to population-based cases for age, gender and ethnicity. Between 2010 and 2012, all controls were selected from the UCSF general medicine phlebotomy clinic. Clinic-based controls were matched to clinic-based glioma cases for age, gender and ethnicity. Consenting participants provided blood, buccal and/or saliva specimens, and information, during in-person or telephone interviews. A total of 677 cases and 3,940 controls (including 3,347 Illumina iControlDB iControls) were used in the current analysis. For the GliomaScan GWAS, in addition to the published analysis, we excluded samples from the ATBC (Finnish study) and controls from NSHDS due to exhibiting outlying population ancestry after manual inspection of PCA plots. In total 1,653 cases and 2,725 controls were used in the current study.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 21630, "infons": {"section_type": "METHODS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "GWAS data from the seven studies were imputed to >10 million SNPs with IMPUTE2 (v2.3) software using a merged reference panel consisting of data from the 1000 Genomes Project (phase 1 integrated release 3, March 2012) and UK10K (ALSPAC, EGAS00001000090 and EGAD00001000195, and TwinsUK EGAS00001000108 and EGAS00001000194 studies). Genotypes were aligned to the positive strand in both imputation and genotyping. Imputation was conducted separately for each study, and in each the data were pruned to a common set of SNPs between cases and controls before imputation. We set thresholds for imputation quality to retain potential risk variants with MAF > 0.01. Poorly imputed SNPs, defined by an information measure <0.40 with IMPUTE2, were excluded, as were SNPs exhibiting a significant deviation from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (P < 1 x 10-8) in controls. Test of association between imputed SNPs and glioma was performed using SNPTEST (v2.5) under an additive frequentist model. The adequacy of the case-control matching and the possibility of differential genotyping of cases and controls were formally evaluated using Q-Q plots of test statistics (Supplementary Fig. 1). Where appropriate, principal components, generated using common SNPs, were included in the analysis to limit the effects of cryptic population stratification that otherwise might cause inflation of test statistics. Principal components, based on genotyped SNPs, were generated for the GICC, GliomaScan, MDA-GWAS and SFAGS studies using PLINK.

This analysis used 574 non-overlapping cases from the UCSF Adult Glioma Study described above. Mayo Clinic and UCSF cases were genotyped using the Illumina Oncoarray. The Mayo Clinic Biobank controls comprised volunteers who donated biological specimens and provided risk factor data, access to clinical data obtained from the medical record and consent to participate in any study approved by the Access Committee. Recruitment for the Mayo Clinic Biobank took place from April 2009 through December 2015. Although participants could be unselected volunteers, the vast majority of participants were contacted as part of a pre-scheduled medical examination in the Department of Medicine, Divisions of Community Internal Medicine, Family Medicine and General Internal Medicine at Mayo Clinic sites in Rochester (Minnesota), Jacksonville (Florida), and the Mayo Clinic Health System sites in La Crosse and Onalaska (Wisconsin).

Subject's sex was verified using the sex check option in PLINK. Relationship checking was performed by estimating the proportion of alleles shared identical by descent (IBD) for all pairs of subjects in PLINK. STRUCTURE was used to assess population admixture with 1000 Genomes as a reference. Subjects indicated to be non-Caucasian were excluded. Prior to imputation, SNPs were tested for HWE, and SNPs with HWE P < 10-6 were removed.

PCA was used to correct for population stratification using SNPs common to cases and controls. The first three principal components were significantly (P < 0.05) associated with case-control status.
