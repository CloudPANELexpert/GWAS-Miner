The observation that the PIK3CG transcript is absent from EBs (Figure 2A) is compatible with the lineage-restricted effect of rs342293 on cell volume. PRKAR2B encodes the beta chain of cAMP-dependent protein kinase, which has an opposing effect to PIK3CG and reduces the release of intracellular calcium by the phosphorylation of ITPR3, the receptor for PIP3.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 22693, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "In our study, the minor G allele at rs342293 was associated with increased MPV (P = 1.08 x 10-24) and also with decreased platelet reactivity measured as the proportion of activated platelets binding annexin V (P = .003) and the level of fibrinogen binding (P = .05). The directionality of association between MPV and the number of annexin V-reactive platelets, measured indirectly through the association with rs342293, thus would appear to support a negative correlation between these 2 variables.

We consider it unlikely that the observed association between sequence variation at rs342293 and the platelet response to CRP-XL is at the level of GPVI membrane expression, because the binding of the anti-GPVI monoclonal antibody HY101 did not differ significantly between the 3 genotype groups from the PFC (data not shown, but see Jones et al).

This is a reasonable assumption that has been validated in our recently completed study of 96 candidate genes encoding proteins in the ADP and CRP-XL pathways, in which we observed that sequence variation in 16 genes was significantly associated with the levels of platelet activation by ADP or CRP-XL (P <= .005).

Both GATA-1 and EVI1 are key transcription factors for megakaryopoiesis. EVI1 is located on chromosome band 3q26, and rearrangements in this region can lead to its overexpression in hematopoietic cells leading to acute myeloid leukemias, which are frequently associated with dystrophic megakaryopoiesis.
