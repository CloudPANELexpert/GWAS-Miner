Research on pathogenesis has traditionally focused on neurotransmitter systems in the brain, particularly those involving dopamine. Schizophrenia has been considered a separate disease for over a century, but in the absence of clear biological markers, diagnosis has historically been based on signs and symptoms. A fundamental message emerging from genome-wide association studies of copy number variations (CNVs) associated with the disease is that its genetic basis does not necessarily conform to classical nosological disease boundaries. Certain CNVs confer not only high relative risk of schizophrenia but also of other psychiatric disorders. The structural variations associated with schizophrenia can involve several genes and the phenotypic syndromes, or the 'genomic disorders', have not yet been characterized. Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based genome-wide association studies with the potential to implicate individual genes in complex diseases may reveal underlying biological pathways. Here we combined SNP data from several large genome-wide scans and followed up the most significant association signals. We found significant association with several markers spanning the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) region on chromosome 6p21.3-22.1, a marker located upstream of the neurogranin gene (NRGN) on 11q24.2 and a marker in intron four of transcription factor 4 (TCF4) on 18q21.2.

The main function of NRGN may be to act as a CaM reservoir, regulating its availability in the postsynaptic compartment. Glutamate stimulation of N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors results in Ca2+ influx to the neuron, NRGN oxidation and release of CaM. The consequent activation of postsynaptic calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) by CaM results in a sustained strengthening of synaptic connections; conversely, CaM activation of calcineurin (PP2B) weakens these connections. CaMKII has a major role in mediating the NMDA-receptor signalling involved in synaptic plasticity and formation of associative memories in the brain. Impaired memory function is thought to be a core feature of the pathophysiology of schizophrenia, especially affecting short term memory where CAMKII is thought to have a major role.

The phenotype need not be as extreme as Pitt-Hopkins syndrome; a de novo translocation disrupting exon 4 of TCF4 was found in an individual with problems restricted to mental retardation.
