However, the genetic underpinnings of fast beta EEG have not previously been studied in a population of African-American ancestry (AA). In a sample of 2382 AA individuals from 482 families drawn from the Collaborative Study on the Genetics of Alcoholism (COGA), we performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) on resting-state fast beta EEG power. To further characterize our genetic findings, we examined the functional and clinical/behavioral significance of GWAS variants. Ten correlated single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (r2>0.9) located in an intergenic region on chromosome 3q26 were associated with fast beta EEG power at P<5 x 10-8. The most significantly associated SNP, rs11720469 (beta: - 0.124; P<4.5 x 10-9), is also an expression quantitative trait locus for BCHE (butyrylcholinesterase), expressed in thalamus tissue. Four of the genome-wide SNPs were also associated with Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders Alcohol Dependence in COGA AA families, and two (rs13093097, rs7428372) were replicated in an independent AA sample (Gelernter et al.). Analyses in the AA adolescent/young adult (offspring from COGA families) subsample indicated association of rs11720469 with heavy episodic drinking (frequency of consuming 5+ drinks within 24 h). Converging findings presented in this study provide support for the role of genetic variants within 3q26 in neural and behavioral disinhibition.

Although local excitatory-inhibitory interactions underlying sensory and motor functions involve gamma-band oscillations, cognitive functions mediated by long-range cortical interactions often involve EEG activity in the beta range.

BChE is synthesized primarily in the liver and is distributed throughout the intestinal mucosa, plasma and the brain. For these reasons, BChE has been conceptualized as a therapeutic agent for CoD. Researchers hypothesize that polymorphisms in BCHE lead to various enzyme profiles that allow different concentrations of cocaine to reach the reward system in the brain, thereby influencing susceptibility to developing addiction. As fast beta EEG has been associated with CoD in rodents and humans, the apparent links among BCHE, fast beta EEG and CoD should be explored further. Post hoc, we examined the association between 3q26 variants and fast beta EEG, adjusted for CoD. Results (Supplementary Figure S3B) show that the 3q26 association remains, although slightly diminished, suggesting that CoD is not driving the association among 3q26 and fast beta EEG in this sample. Also of potential relevance, variations within BCHE have also been implicated in association studies of learning and memory, cognitive functioning, schizophrenia and Alzheimer's disease.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 23594, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "title_2"}, "text": "3q26, fast beta EEG, substance use behaviors/disorders", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 23649, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "In COGA AA families, individuals with elevated fast beta EEG were more likely to meet criteria for AD (P<0.01), and a small, but significant portion of the variance shared among fast beta EEG and AD is attributable to genome-wide variants (genetic correlation, as estimated by GCTA: 0.10, s.e.: 0.17). There is evidence of association between 4 of the 10 variants meeting genome-wide criteria for fast beta EEG and AD (rs7428372 and rs13093097 survived a multiple test correction), suggesting a potential protective role for fast beta EEG variants in AD in the primary GWAS sample.

Previous studies indicate that compared with non-binge drinkers or mild-binge drinkers, more severe-binge drinkers have increased fast beta EEG (20-35 Hz).

To assess this, post hoc we examined the association between 3q26 variants and fast beta EEG, adjusted for AD. Results (Supplementary Figure S3A) show that the 3q26 association remains but is slightly diminished, suggesting that AD may have an indirect role in the association of 3q26 and fast beta EEG in this sample. Stated another way, fast beta EEG may be a risk factor for some, but not all individuals with AD.
