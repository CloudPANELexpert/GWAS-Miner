GKRP binds to glucokinase (GCK) and inhibits its activities. GCK is a rate-limiting enzyme in hepatic glucose uptake and glycogen storage, and is a negative modifier of hepatic gluconeogenesis. GKRP with the T allele at rs1260326 shows reduced binding to GCK, thereby increasing GCK activity in the liver, promoting hepatic glucose uptake and lowering blood glucose. These effects could also increase blood lactate. In carriers of the T allele, the rate of gluconeogenesis may be lower; therefore, lactate utilization will also be lower, as it is an important substrate for gluconeogenesis. Essentially, the GCKR polymorphism might influence Cori cycle kinetics, resulting in different glucose and lactate concentrations at steady state. As a result, the T allele at rs1260326 is associated with lower glucose and reduced risk of incident diabetes but higher lactate levels.

We speculate that the strong association of the index variants at GCKR and PPP1R3B/LOC157273 with plasma lactate is a consequence of the involvement of the underlying causal variants in hepatic gluconeogenesis, which is a major determinant of plasma lactate levels, while the causal variants of the other diabetes-related loci are functional in other tissues or pathways and therefore had much weaker or little association with plasma lactate levels. For example, GCK is important in glucose metabolism in both beta-cells and hepatocytes, and the index variant of GCK (rs4607517) in the GWASs of glycaemic traits is in high linkage disequilibrium with a variant in the beta-cell-specific promoter of GCK and not variants in the hepatocyte-specific promoter. This could explain why rs4607517 had little association with plasma lactate in our analysis (P=0.41). The strong associations of the index SNPs at GCKR and PPP1R3B/ LOC157273 with plasma lactate among European-American subjects without diabetes, after adjusting for fasting insulin, also supports the hypothesis that the genetic association of plasma lactate at these two loci are not mediated by insulin resistance or beta-cell function.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 17719, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "title_3"}, "text": "Interaction between metformin and lactate-associated variants", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 17781, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Metformin decreases the uptake of lactate as a substrate of hepatic gluconeogenesis and thus increases lactate levels. There was no interaction between the index SNP at GCKR and metformin with regard to lactate levels. As the index SNP at GCKR and metformin are both associated with higher lactate through decreased gluconeogenesis, at least in part, this lack of interaction suggests that the effect of these factors is not multiplicative. In contrast, PPP1R3B/LOC157273 was associated with higher lactate among subjects with diabetes taking metformin than among those not taking metformin. The causal variant(s) at PPP1R3B/LOC157273 may be associated with increased conversion of glucose to lactate because the conversion of glucose to glycogen is decreased; therefore, among those taking metformin, excess lactate produced cannot be converted back to glucose via gluconeogenesis because metformin decreases the rate of gluconeogenesis. In addition to inhibiting gluconeogenesis, metformin also lowers glucose levels by suppressing glucagon signalling, which mediates the conversion of glycogen to glucose, while PPP1R3B is involved in the pathway of glycogen synthesis from glucose. If decreased glycogenolysis attributable to metformin leads to a response that reduces glycogen synthesis, then the synergistic effect between metformin and the lactate-increasing variant near PPP1R3B is biologically plausible. This is the first genome-wide association study of plasma lactate in a population-based cohort that includes subjects of both European and African origin.
