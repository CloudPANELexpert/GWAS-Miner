Identification of AAO genes may help to understand the biological mechanisms that regulate the onset of the disease. Here we report the first GWAS focused on identifying genes for the AAO of AD. We performed a genome-wide meta analysis on 3 samples comprising a total of 2,222 AD cases. A total of ~2.5 million directly genotyped or imputed SNPs were analyzed in relation to AAO of AD. As expected, the most significant associations were observed in the APOE region on chromosome 19 where several SNPs surpassed the conservative genome-wide significant threshold (P<5E-08). The most significant SNP outside the APOE region was located in the DCHS2 gene on chromosome 4q31.3 (rs1466662; P=4.95E-07). There were 19 additional significant SNPs in this region at P<1E-04 and the DCHS2 gene is expressed in the cerebral cortex and thus is a potential candidate for affecting AAO in AD.

Genetically, AD is a complex and multifactorial disease with the possible involvement of multiple genes. The rare early-onset form of the disease usually follows an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern and to date three genes have been identified: amyloid precursor protein (APP) and presenilin 1 and 2 (PSEN1, PSEN2). The common late-onset form of the disease is much more complex than the early-onset form and until recently the apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene was the only major genetic factor accounting for 20-29% of the risk for late-onset AD. Recent large genome-wide association studies have identified nine additional genes for late-onset AD, including CR1, BIN1, CLU (a.k.a. APOJ), PICALM, MS4A4/MS4A6E, CD2AP, CD33, EPHA1 and ABCA7.

The APOE gene, in addition to affecting the risk of AD, also has a significant impact on AAO of AD and explains about 10% of its variation. Several additional loci with effect sizes similar to or even greater than that of APOE have been suggested. However, some additional genes implicated in AAO of AD have effect sizes far less than the effect of APOE. Recently a genome-wide association study (GWAS) implicated a locus on chromosome 14 with AAO of AD, but it was not confirmed in a replication study. In this study we have used GWAS data from three independent samples in an effort to identify additional AAO loci in AD.

The third top SNP on 3p14 (rs704454) is near the ADAMTS9 gene which is expressed in spinal cord and brain along with other tissues and ADAMTS9 is a susceptibility gene for type 2 diabetes. The fourth top SNP on 9p24 (rs2034764) is in the KCNV2 gene which is adjacent to the VLDL-receptor (VLDLR) gene that is expressed in the brain and binds to APOE and genetic variation in VLDLR has previously been linked to dementia.
