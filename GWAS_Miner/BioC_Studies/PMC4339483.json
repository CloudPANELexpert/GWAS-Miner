In the transformation of DPA-n3 to DHA, elongation to tetracosapentaenoic acid (TPA; more commonly 24:5n3) by ELOVL2 is a key step, and SNPs contributing to reduced efficiency in this process would be expected to produce more DPAn3, less TPA, and less DHA as the end product.

LPCAT3 favors the transfer of saturated, as opposed to unsaturated, fatty acids. While other LPAT genes have been identified in GWAS studies on lipid endpoints or, shown to be associated with cardiovascular risk, LPCAT3 is a novel observation with SNPs explaining a modest amount of variation in LA and OA. The sn2 position of phospholipids primarily carries polyunsaturated fatty acids, and limitation of LPCAT3 activity increases the abundance of polyunsaturated fatty acids, such as linoleic acid, over monounsaturated fatty acids such as oleic acid as observed here. Given the general interest in altering the relative abundances of these two fatty acid classes this association could provide valuable insight to underlying biology.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 23142, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The only published reports correlating RBC fatty acid composition to endpoints in the Framingham Offspring Cohort focused on the long-chain omega-3 fatty acids EPA and DHA or trans fatty acids. It is important to note that none of the SNP - fatty acid relations observed in this current analysis found significant associations for any of these fatty acids. This is perhaps because RBC levels of these fatty acids are more strongly determined by variations in dietary intake than are any other fatty acids. However, other explanations are also possible (see following paragraph for some details). We previously reported that \"heritability\" explained much of the variability in RBC EPA+DHA (the Omega-3 Index) in this cohort. When estimates of EPA+DHA intake (from food and supplements) were added to the model, the proportion of variability assigned to heritability diminished from 50% to 32%, suggesting that commonalities in eating patterns among families accounted for a large portion of heritability. In the present analysis, dietary fatty acid intake was not taken into account (since fatty acid intake data were not available for 1/4 of the cohort), and thus our ability to detect genetic influences was likely diminished due to unaccounted effects of diet on RBC fatty acid patterns. Other efforts have suggested 40-70% of variation in fatty acids is accounted for by genetic variation. However, multiple types of genetic information from very large cohorts may be needed to reveal genetic vs. non-genetic influences in phenotypes.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 24688, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "title_2"}, "text": "4.6 Limitations", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 24704, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "While this analysis has yielded a mix of biologically plausible novel genetic loci, as well as replicating prior genome-wide associations, there are a few limitations worth noting. The first was the lack of dietary data (especially relevant for EPA and DHA) described above, with the related issue that proportions of multiple RBC fatty acids can be highly inter-correlated. Further work is necessary to develop fatty acid-specific models that leverage dietary covariates, that explicitly model the complex correlation structure between fatty acids, and that consider ratios of fatty acids as opposed to single fatty acids. Second, our analysis only considers common variants. Exome sequencing of the Framingham Offspring cohort is ongoing, and future analyses should consider the potential role of rare genetic variation in explaining fatty acid levels. Third, the family structure of the Framingham data meant that the effective sample size for our analysis was lower than the actual sample size of 2,633, limiting power to identify associated SNPs. Fourth, as is the case with any genome-wide association study, use of conservative significance levels, as we have done here, provides protection against false positives, but can lead to reduced ability (low power) to identify additional phenotype-genotype associations. Alternative methods (e.g., candidate gene/pathway analyses that build more biologically-informed statistical models), combining this sample with others, or gathering additional larger samples will be needed to further characterize potential gene-fatty acid relationships. These further analyses should also consider the potential role that rare (MAF<1%) genetic variation may play in fatty acid metabolism. Finally, replication of the novel loci identified in this paper should be sought after in independent samples, along with consideration of impact of causal loci on gene expression and associations with DNA methylation.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 26653, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "title_2"}, "text": "4.7 Conclusions", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 26669, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "In seeking SNP relations for fourteen red blood fatty acid levels, we identified three novel loci, and replicated two others.
