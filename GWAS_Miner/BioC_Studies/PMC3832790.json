For comparison, the former risk estimate is similar to that conferred by deleterious mutations in BRCA2 (ref.), and such mutation carriers are undergoing targeted screening in trials, for example, in the IMPACT (Identification of Men with a genetic predisposition to ProstAte Cancer: Targeted screening in men at higher genetic risk and controls) Study (see URLs). The SNP-based prostate cancer risk profile now available should therefore be able to distinguish men at a clinically meaningful level of risk. To evaluate the combined effect of the loci associated with prostate cancer risk, we included 68 of the known loci in a logistic regression (59 which were on iCOGS and 9 for which a surrogate with r2 > 0.76 was available). The parameters from this model were used to generate polygenic risk scores (Online Methods). On the basis of these scores, the estimated risk for men in the top 1% of the risk distribution was 4.4-fold greater than the population average risk (Supplementary Table 8), very close to the theoretical estimate predicted under a simple polygenic model (4.7-fold). Furthermore, under a polygenic genetic risk model, an unaffected man aged 50 who has a father with prostate cancer diagnosed at 60 years of age would have a predicted lifetime risk of prostate cancer from his family history alone of just over 20%. However, if family history is taken into consideration along with the explicit effects of all known common prostate cancer susceptibility alleles, this predicted risk would rise to just over 60% if he were in the top 1% of the known polygenic risk score distribution (A. Antoniou, personal communication). Such differences in predicted risks will be important for facilitating risk stratification in targeted screening and prevention programs.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 18436, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "URLs", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 18441, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "COGs website, http://ec.europa.eu/research/health/medical-research/cancer/fp7-projects/cogs_en.html;", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 18542, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "IMPACT Study, http://www.impact-study.co.uk/;", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 18588, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "SNAP plots from the University of Michigan, http://csg.sph.umich.edu/locuszoom/;", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 18669, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "SNPTEST, https://mathgen.stats.ox.ac.uk/genetics_software/snptest/snptest.html;", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 18749, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "MACH 1.0, http://www.sph.umich.edu/csg/abecasis/MACH/;", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 18804, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "PRACTICAL, http://ccge.medschl.cam.ac.uk/consortia/practical/index.html;", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 18877, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "GeneGo (now Thomson Reuters), http://thomsonreuters.com/products_services/science/systems-biology/;", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 18977, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "CGEMS Project, http://dceg.cancer.gov/research/how-we-study/genomic-studies/cgems-summary;", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 19068, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "BPC3, http://epi.grants.cancer.gov/BPC3/cohorts.html;", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 19122, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "CAPS, http://ki.se/ki/jsp/polopoly.jsp?d=13809&a=29862&l=en;", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 19183, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "SCCS, http://www.southerncommunitystudy.org/.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 19229, "infons": {"section_type": "METHODS", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "ONLINE METHODS", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 19244, "infons": {"section_type": "METHODS", "type": "title_2"}, "text": "GWAS analysis", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 19258, "infons": {"section_type": "METHODS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Primary genotype data were obtained for three prostate cancer GWAS (CGEMS, UK/Australia stages 1 and 2, and CAPS).
