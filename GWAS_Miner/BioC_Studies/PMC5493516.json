In contrast to many other cancer types, the curative cisplatin-based treatment regimens and doses for testicular cancer are standardized across the world, allowing us to assess CAO in a large number of homogeneously treated patients.

In addition, prior GWAS have shown WFS1 may also play a role in type 2 diabetes susceptibility. Testicular cancer survivors are at increased risk of type II diabetes, but small numbers of diabetic patients (n = 14) in our cohort limited our ability to evaluate this association. Dominant mutations that cause low-frequency hearing loss are nearly always found in the 3' end of WFS1 and are usually non-inactivating. On the other hand, WFS1 mutations causing the recessive Wolfram syndrome are numerous, usually loss-of-function, and distributed along the entire gene. Hearing impairment in patients with Wolfram syndrome is progressive and largely affects the high frequencies, as is also true for CAO, with hearing loss presenting in the 4-12 kHz range, which is critical for speech perception. The top GWAS SNP, rs62283056, is in the first intron of WFS1 (5' end) and the risk allele is associated with lower expression (loss-of-function) of the gene.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 22482, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "WFS1 encodes wolframin, which normally controls endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response through degradation of ATF6alpha, a key transcription factor involved in ER stress signaling. As shown in pancreatic beta-cells from Wfs1-/- mice and human lymphocytes from Wolfram syndrome patients, dysfunction of wolframin in inner ear cells likely results in increased expression of the ER stress response genes and apoptosis. In addition to causing DNA damage, cisplatin also induces ER stress and nucleus-independent apoptosis. Because both cisplatin and WFS1 loss-of-function induce ER stress, increased ER stress is likely one potential mechanism for the significant interaction we found between cumulative cisplatin dose and rs62283056 genotype, with higher cisplatin dose exacerbating hearing loss in patients carrying the minor allele.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 23319, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The association between decreased expression of WFS1 and hearing loss was replicated among 18,620 patients in the BioVU cohort using more general hearing loss phenotypes that encompasses multiple causes.

We note that the SNPs mapping to the extended loci defined by the deafness genes are not protein-altering mutations that would cause deafness. Rather, a subset of these SNPs are likely to affect expression of the local gene, thereby leading to an increased risk of CAO and general hearing loss. Future GWAS of CAO with larger sample sizes may reveal additional variants in deafness gene loci that meet genome-wide significance. Consistent with the enrichment results in these loci, the heritability estimate for CAO (0.92 +- 0.62, P = 0.039) using a variance-component approach provides preliminary support to the hypothesis that many common variants with small effect sizes underlie CAO; thus, it is a polygenic trait.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 24724, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Lack of replication of candidate genes reported in previous smaller studies of CAO (n = 130-254 patients) also supports the hypothesis that large-effect variants for ototoxicity are unlikely. However, differences in CAO phenotypes and patient cohorts (Supplementary Table S4) could also explain inability to replicate previous findings. For example, unlike in our investigation, in the St. Jude GWAS, ototoxicity was prospectively modeled as a time-to-event variable in a clinical trial, which may better capture acute effects. A previous GWAS of age-related hearing impairment in a Belgian population also supported a polygenic architecture; although no individual variant attained genome-wide significance, 22% of the variance in hearing loss was explained by the collective effect of all genotyped SNPs, although the standard error was not reported.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 25579, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Taken together, our results show for the first time a shared genetic etiology among drug-induced, Mendelian, and other types of hearing impairment.

SNPs in VAC14 associated with docetaxel-induced peripheral neuropathy, and the gene was recently shown to be mutated in pediatric-onset neurological disease. Beyond chemotherapy studies, genetic variants that associate with the euphoric effects of d-amphetamine significantly overlap with variants that decrease risk for schizophrenia and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.

Therefore, following a GWAS of an adverse drug event, a related general, multi-cause phenotype with a larger sample size, but less detailed clinical data, could be used for replication. Polygenic analyses of both the adverse drug event and the general phenotype could be performed to quantify the shared genetic architecture and to provide the basis for not only clinical risk prediction, but also preventive and interventional strategies.

We performed a genome-wide association study of CAO among testicular cancer survivors treated with homogenous cisplatin-based chemotherapy. One SNP in WFS1 met genome-wide significance, with the risk allele also associated with decreased WFS1 expression. WFS1 mutations can cause the Mendelian disorders DFNA6 (deafness, autosomal dominant 6) and Wolfram Syndrome (with hearing loss). The significant interaction we found between cumulative cisplatin dose and the WFS1 SNP indicates that ototoxicity in patients with the risk allele could be reduced with lower doses of cisplatin. Replication of the association between decreased WFS1 expression and hearing loss in the BioVU cohort demonstrates that genetic findings related to an adverse drug event can be replicated among patients with a related phenotype using electronic health record data.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}], "annotations": [], "relations": []}]}
