Neither rs3814113 nor the highly correlated SNP, rs4445329, (r2 > 0.99) are located within an open reading frame or an intronic region of any gene. The nearest genes are BNC2 (basonuclin 2), CNTLN (centlein, a centrosomal protein) and hypothetical gene LOC648570. rs3814113 is ~44kb upstream of BNC2, ~128kb upstream of LOC648570 and ~220kb downstream of CNTLN. Eight of the associated SNPs in the region are located within intron 2 of BNC2 (Figure 2). BNC2 encodes DNA-binding zinc-finger protein that is highly conserved across vertebrates suggesting it is an important regulatory protein for DNA transcription. The gene exhibits extensive transcriptional variability; it has six promoters and has the potential to generate up to 90,000 mRNA isoforms encoding more than 2,000 different proteins. The Genevar project provides data on gene expression of BNC2 in lymphocyte derived cell lines from the CEU population based on nine probes in the region. There was no association for any of these probes and genotype at the top 12 SNPs. Also none of the top 12 SNPs appear to be near predictable or known enhancer binding sites or splice sites using PupaSNP (http://www.pupasnp.org/). BNC2 is highly expressed in reproductive tissues (ovary and testis) and may play a role in the differentiation of spermatoza and oocytes. There is little evidence of a role for BNC2 in cancer development, although there is a report of 7~9 fold up-regulated expression in basal cell carcinoma compared to normal basal cells. Resequencing of the 9p22.2 region and further genotyping in ovarian cancer cases and controls will be needed to clarify the likely causal variant(s).", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 10312, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "We found no additional susceptibility loci reaching genome wide significance (P<10-8) in this study. Positive associations have previously been reported in candidate gene studies, but none of these reached genome-wide significance. Supplementary Table 6 shows some of the more notable published associations together with the results for the same SNPs from this study. In general the reported associations and our results are consistent, but none of the associations in this study ranked highly enough for the SNP to be included in the Stage 2 genotyping. The power to have identified rs3814113 depends on the true relative risk. Assuming a relative risk per-minor allele of 0.82 (combined data estimate), power was > 90% at genome-wide significance, suggesting that common alleles of larger effect are unlikely to have been missed. However, if the true per-allele relative risk is 0.88 (stage 3 estimate) then the power was only 20% suggesting that susceptibility alleles with more modest effects remain to be identified. Furthermore, power to detect less common alleles will be limited unless the effect on risk is greater. For example, we have 90 percent power at genome-wide significance to detect a risk allele with 5 percent frequency that confers a relative risk of 1.44. This would be consistent with the findings for other common cancer types (e.g. breast cancer and prostate cancers). In addition, disease heterogeneity may have limited our power to identify additional susceptibility alleles. In the primary analysis, we considered ovarian cancer as a single disease phenotype, but the effects of association for rs3814113 varied when cases were stratified by histological subtype. Different subtypes of ovarian cancer have different biological properties and this finding supports previous studies that suggest susceptibility due to germline genetic variation may be subtype specific. For example, serous and endometrioid cancer are relatively more common in BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers whereas mutations in the DNA mismatch repair genes are more frequently associated with mucinous ovarian cancers. Additional ovarian cancer susceptibility loci may exist that are associated with specific histological or molecular subtypes. However, the power to identify alleles for the rarer subtypes (endometrioid, mucinous and clear cell ovarian cancers) was limited by the numbers of cases in the study. It is likely that pooling of data from multiple ovarian cancer GWAS will enable additional susceptibility alleles for invasive ovarian cancer in general and for specific sub-types to be identified.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 12924, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The identification of common ovarian cancer susceptibility variants may have clinical implications in the future for identifying patients at greatest risk of the disease. Survival rates in patients diagnosed with ovarian cancer are poor - approximately 70% of patients are diagnosed with late stage disease and less than 40% of these cases survive more than 5 years after their diagnosis. The efficacy of using multi-modal approaches to early detection of the disease are limited, but may be improved by using genetic risk profiling to identify a subset of the population that would benefit most from earlier disease detection. The benefits of a similar approach have recently been modelled in breast cancer. Identifying genetic variants that cause ovarian cancer may also improve our understanding of the underlying biology of ovarian cancer, potentially leading to the development of more effective, individualised therapies. For example, the identification of the highly penetrant susceptibility genes BRCA1 and BRCA2, and their subsequent functional characterisation has since led the to development of a potential novel therapy for patients deficient in BRCA1/2 function based on inhibition of the poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase PARP DNA repair pathway.

For the stage 2 analysis, we tested for association by performing logistic regression using the imputed values from stage 1, combined with the genotyping results for stage 2. We corrected for the first principal component and the ethnicity estimates in the second stage analysis (all subjects in the first stage were selected to be European) and stratified by study using a Wald test. We corrected for ethnicity in stage 3 using self reported ethnicity and stratified by study. A subgroup analysis was used to compare genotype-specific risks by disease subgroup with controls. The effect of age group, family history and population of origin (European and non-European) was assessed similarly. Modification by these sub-groups was tested by fitting a SNP by subgroup interaction term in a logistic regression model.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 21853, "infons": {"section_type": "SUPPL", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "Supplementary Material", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 21876, "infons": {"section_type": "FIG", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "Figures and Tables", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 21895, "infons": {"file": "nihms146644f1.jpg", "id": "F1", "section_type": "FIG", "type": "fig_caption"}, "text": "Genotype-specific risks of SNP rs3814113 for ovarian cancer by stage and by study - (a) all epithelial ovarian cancer cases, (b) serous ovarian cancer cases only.
