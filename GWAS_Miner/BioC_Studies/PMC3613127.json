Partly because early case-control studies of T2D were designed to maximize the likelihood of detecting variants increasing T2D risk directly rather than through mediation of adiposity, most of the associated loci discovered in these studies uncovered genes related to beta cell dysfunction. More recently, we have shown that the genetic architecture of quantitative indices of beta-cell function and of insulin resistance differs markedly: given the same individuals, sample sizes and biochemical measurements, we described a larger number of signals for beta cell function than for insulin resistance. While this observation is consistent with the higher reported heritability of insulin secretion compared to resistance, overall heritability estimates of insulin resistance in individuals of European ancestry of 25%-44% suggest that many loci remain to be discovered and that novel strategies are required for their localization.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 2341, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Obesity is an important determinant of insulin resistance. It was postulated that adiposity might modulate the genetic determinants of insulin resistance and contribute to the heterogeneity of T2D etiology. Wang et al. demonstrated that heritability of insulin resistance increases with higher body mass index (BMI), while some candidate gene studies have observed that genetic effect size varies with adiposity level: findings compatible with the presence of underlying interaction between BMI and genetic variants for insulin resistance. Furthermore, hormones, adipokines and proinflammatory cytokines produced by adipose tissue can influence insulin signaling via diverse mechanisms, which may interact with genetic variants influencing insulin resistance pathways. Therefore, to localize variants associated with insulin resistance it may also be important to account for gene variant by BMI interaction, which would allow for the potential of adiposity levels to perturb the physiological milieu in which genetic variants in insulin signaling pathways operate. Adiposity may also hinder the localization of genetic variants influencing insulin resistance by introducing extra variance in the outcome that is not attributable to genetic variation, suggesting that adjustment for adiposity per se may be necessary.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 3659, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Kraft et al. proposed a joint test that investigates the association between an outcome and a genetic variant, while allowing for possible effect modification by an environmental variable.

We used the JMA approach because we hypothesized that the degree of adiposity may mask, positively confound, or modify the association between genetic variants and insulin resistance traits. While the associations we observed resulted mainly from adjustment for BMI, the JMA method allowed the flexibility and power to observe these main effect-driven associations, whilst allowing us to simultaneously test our hypothesis of interaction.

The JMA is an effective screening tool when the underlying interaction model is unknown and, importantly, retains power when there is no interaction effect. The JMA provides estimates of betaSNP and betaSNPxBMI and allows for a 2 degree of freedom joint test of the null hypothesis H0: betaSNP =betaSNPxBMI =0, as well as a test of heterogeneity of regression coefficients. Additionally, the JMA detects association in the presence of either a significant SNP effect, adjusted for BMI, or a SNPxBMI interaction effect.
