The phenotype is highly variable even among patients harboring identical GBA1 mutations. We hypothesized that modifier gene(s) underlie phenotypic diversity in GD and performed a GWAS study in Ashkenazi Jewish patients with type 1 GD (GD1), homozygous for N370S mutation. Patients were assigned to mild, moderate or severe disease category using composite disease severity scoring systems. Whole-genome genotyping for >500,000 SNPs was performed to search for associations using OQLS algorithm in 139 eligible patients. Several SNPs in linkage disequilibrium within the CLN8 gene locus were associated with the GD1 severity: SNP rs11986414 was associated with GD1 severity at p value 1.26 x 10-6. Compared to mild disease, risk allele A at rs11986414 conferred an odds ratio of 3.72 for moderate/severe disease. Loss of function mutations in CLN8 causes neuronal ceroid-lipofuscinosis but our results indicate that its increased expression may protect against severe GD1. In cultured skin fibroblasts, the relative expression of CLN8 was higher in mild GD compared to severely affected patients in whom CLN8 risk alleles were over-represented. In an in vitro cell model of GD, CLN8 expression was increased which was further enhanced in the presence of bioactive substrate, glucosylsphingosine. Taken together, CLN8 is a candidate modifier gene for GD1 that may function as a protective sphingolipid sensor and/or in glycosphingolipid trafficking. Future studies should explore the role of CLN8 in pathophysiology of GD.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 1872, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "Introduction", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 1885, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "In Gaucher disease (GD), the defective activity of acid beta-glucosidase due to mutations in the GBA1 gene leads to progressive accumulation of the substrate, glucocerebroside in the lysosomes of mononuclear phagocytes.

Database included longitudinal phenotype data regarding bone, hematology, visceral involvement, age of onset, severity score index and whether prior splenectomy had been performed. Liver and spleen volumes were determined by volumetric MRI and depicted as fold-enlargement compared to normal (x N); normal liver volume is 2.5% body weight and spleen volume 0.2% body weight as described previously. Hemoglobin, platelet count, MRI, Hermann Score, DXA scan, Bone Marrow Burden (BMB) score were determined prior to ERT. Overall disease severity was determined according to Severity Score Index (SSI) and the recently validated DS3 score. Age of onset of symptoms, age at splenectomy and age at initiation of ERT were also recorded in the database. We aimed to assess association of SNPs based on ordinal ranking of disease severity, and therefore, the patients were assigned categories of mild, moderate and severe disease (Table I). After initial scoring via DS3 and SSI, patients were ranked by disease severity from most mild to severe. Additionally, experts in Gaucher disease (PKM and GMP) who have followed patients for >10 yrs assigned a global assessment of disease severity of the patient. Using the DS3, SSI score and global assessments, patients were assigned to severity categories of mild, moderate and severe. Illustrative natural history of mildly affected GD1 patient compared to severely affected patient is depicted in Supplementary Figure 1. In addition to variation in overall disease severity, GD is recognized to exhibit different patterns of disease among affected patients, i.e., visceral vs skeletal disease. Therefore, in addition to overall disease severity, we assessed severity of individual disease compartments. A category designation was created for bone disease severity as well as severity of visceral disease. For bone disease, severity was based on pre-ERT Hermann score as described previously with scores 1-2 classified as mild, 3 as moderate, and 4-5 as severe.

Curiously, lowest expression was observed in brain tissues, which is most vulnerable to loss of function mutations in this gene.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 24637, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "Discussion", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 24648, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The basis of remarkable variation of severity of GD1 and its heterogeneity among patients with identical GBA1 gene mutations is not understood.

The chronicity and the heterogeneity of the disease as well as the lack of sufficiently well-characterized patients limit the ability to conduct such studies. The greatest hurdle is that the new generation of patients tends to be treated early before the full natural history unfolds. Therefore the accuracy of ascertainment of true disease phenotype with respect to severity is severely compromised. Moreover, the instruments to depict disease severity have limitations to adequately capture the full scope of heterogeneity of disease manifestations. The latter is exemplified most strikingly by some GD patients who predominantly exhibit bone manifestations with only mild visceral or hematological disease and vice versa; these patterns are in contrast to occasional patients who manifest uniformly severe disease in all disease compartments. These patterns of disease, may in fact be driven by modifier gene(s) that underlie monocyte trafficking and/or macrophage-mediated determinants of individual organ injury. Therefore, in our study, we elected to depict disease severity by multiple approaches, including SSI, validated DS3 as well as global physician assessment by two investigators with extensive experience of GD. Moreover, we also examined individual disease compartments, including the viscera and the bone. Thus the final dataset of mild, moderate and severe disease are remarkably consistent with these classifications in the context of overall disease severity as well as severity of individual disease compartments (Table I).", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 26910, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Our study revealed several candidate modifier genes, not previously considered on the basis of current understanding of GD pathophysiology: CLN8, ADAM12 and ANGPT4. The lead candidate modifier gene was CLN8. The physiological function of CLN8 is not known but a loss of function mutation is responsible for a subtype of neuronal ceroid-lipofuscinosis (NCL), the Northern epilepsy mental retardation (EPMR) syndrome, characterized by seizures in childhood and progressive mental retardation. The CLN8 gene encodes a predicted 286-amino acid transmembrane protein containing a C-terminal ER-retrieval signal (KKRP) Consistent with this structure, CLN8 protein, a nonglycosylated membrane protein, is located in the ER and shuttles between the ER and the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment. Highest expression of CLN8 is surprisingly in the liver and the spleen (compared to the brain) and it has been suggested that it plays an important role as a sensor of sphingolipids and sphingolipid trafficking in all cell types. CLN8 is a member of a family of homologues that includes ER-resident proteins: yeast Lag1p and human TRAM (translocating chain-associating membrane protein). A C-terminal motif of 200 amino acid residues designated the Tram- Lag-CLN8 (TLC) domain in these proteins has been proposed to play a role in ceramide synthesis and glycosphingolipid trafficking.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 28284, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "In an induced in vitro cellular model of GD, we found there was an induction of CLN8 expression and the level of expression was further increased in the presence of potent bioactive lipid substrate of acid beta-glucosidase, Lyso-GL1. In cells derived from, GD1 patients, there was increased basal expression of CLN8 relative to control cells; moreover there was a trend towards increased expression in patients with mild disease compared to patients with moderate/severe disease. We found the SNP alleles in CLN8 region associated with severe GD correlated with relatively lower expression of CLN8 compared to the lower risk alleles (Figure 3). Interestingly, CLN8 and CLN6, two integral ER trans-membrane proteins and cathepsin D, are increased in expression (3-4-fold) in the spleens of mice with conditional deletion of GBA1; loss of function mutations in these three genes result in NCLs. Moreover, MYC, a regulator of CLN8 was marginally associated with GD1 severity (top SNP p value 4.96 x 10-5). Finally interrogation of Novartis gene expression pattern highlighted prominent relative expression of CLN8 in immune cells compared to other cell types and organs.
