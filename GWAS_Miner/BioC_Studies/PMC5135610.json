Here we report the results of a genome-wide association study of germline DNA from 4,658 women, including 252 women experiencing a breast cancer recurrence, who were entered on the MA.27 adjuvant trial comparing the aromatase inhibitors (AI) anastrozole and exemestane. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) of top significance were identified in the gene encoding MIR2052HG, a long noncoding RNA of unknown function. Heterozygous or homozygous individuals for variant alleles exhibited a ~40% or ~63% decrease, respectively, in the hazard of breast cancer recurrence relative to homozygous wild-type individuals. Functional genomic studies in lymphoblastoid cell lines and ERalpha-positive breast cancer cell lines showed that expression from MIR2052HG and the ESR1 gene encoding estrogen receptor-alpha (ERalpha) was induced by estrogen and AI in a SNP-dependent manner. Variant SNP genotypes exhibited increased ERalpha binding to estrogen response elements, relative to wild-type genotypes, a pattern that was reversed by AI treatment. Further, variant SNPs were associated with lower expression of MIR2052HG and ERalpha. RNAi-mediated silencing of MIR2052HG in breast cancer cell lines decreased ERalpha expression, cell proliferation and anchorage-independent colony formation. Mechanistic investigations revealed that MIR2052HG sustained ERalpha levels both by promoting AKT/FOXO3-mediated ESR1 transcription and by limiting ubiquitin-mediated, proteasome-dependent degradation of ERalpha. Taken together, our results define MIR2052HS as a functionally polymorphic gene that affects risks of breast cancer recurrence in women treated with AI.

Knock down of MIR2052HG resulted in striking decreases of ERalpha expression, both at the mRNA and the protein levels (Figs. 4A and 4B), consistent with the TCGA data that showed a positive correlation between the two genes. Furthermore, in MCF7/AC1 cells, knock down of MIR2052HG decreased cell proliferation and colony formation (Figs. 4C and 4D), while overexpression of MIR2052HG increased cell proliferation, colony formation, and ERalpha expression (Fig. 4E), functionally confirming the positive relationship between ERalpha and MIR2052HG.

Treatment with cycloheximide, resulted in a decrease in the half-life of ERalpha protein in cells in which MIR2052HG had been knocked down (Fig. 5A and 5B). We also treated MIR2052HG knock down cells with MG132, a proteasome inhibitor, and found that it reversed ERalpha degradation in these cells (Fig. 5C, upper panel). The same phenomenon was observed using bortezomib, another specific proteasome inhibitor (Fig. 5C, lower panel). These results indicated that MIR2052HG regulates ERalpha protein stability through a proteasome-mediated degradation pathway. Furthermore, we observed that ERalpha ubiquitination increased after knocking down MIR2052HG in 293T cells (Fig. 5D), confirming the involvement of ubiquitin-dependent and proteasome-mediated degradation.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 23197, "infons": {"section_type": "RESULTS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "We next examined possible mechanisms by which MIR2052HG was involved in the control of ERalpha transcription. During these experiments, we observed in both MCF7/AC1 and CAMA1 cells that down-regulation of MIR2052HG resulted in increased phospho-AKT (pAKT) levels at both the Ser473 and Thr308 sites, but total AKT levels did not change (Fig 5E). Because FOXO3 is downstream of AKT and activated AKT phosphorylates FOXO3 resulting in degradation of FOXO3 through a proteasome-dependent process, we determined the effects of MIR2052HG knock down on total FOXO3 and phospho-FOXO3 levels (on S318/S321) and observed both of them to be reduced (Fig. 5E), consistent with the known effect of pAKT. It is also well known that FOXO3 regulates the expression of ERalpha and that the expression of FOXO3 is directly correlated with the expression of ERalpha. To further confirm that the regulation of ESR1 mRNA levels by MIR2052HG is mediated through the regulation of FOXO3, we overexpressed FOXO3 in MCF/AC1 cells, in which MIR2052HG had been knocked down, and observed that FOXO3 overexpression could reverse the down-regulation of ESR1 mRNA caused by knocking down MIR2052HG (Fig. 5F). In summary, these results indicate that the down-regulation of MIR2052HG can reduce ESR1 mRNA levels by promoting AKT-mediated down-regulation of FOXO3, which regulates ESR1 transcription.

In the current study, our goal was to interrogate the germline genome for SNPs related to breast cancer events in women treated with adjuvant AI therapy, relate those SNPs to genes, and perform functional studies to identify potential mechanisms for the observed associations. We controlled for significant imbalances in three stratification factors by performing stratified Cox analyses and for the effects of baseline factors that impacted BCFI with their forced inclusion in the Cox model. The p-values for the top SNPs were approximately 2E-07, which approaches, but does not reach genome-wide significance.

There is also increasing evidence suggesting lncRNAs play important roles in cancers. For example, HOTAIR (Hox antisense intergenic RNA) is highly induced in about one-quarter of patients with breast cancer. The long intergenic non-coding RNA-ROR has been shown to induce epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and contribute to breast cancer metastasis and to enhance ERalpha signaling, conferring resistance to tamoxifen. A recent study also indicated that a cluster of lncRNAs, termed Eleanors (ESR1 locus enhancing and activating noncoding RNAs) located within the genomic region containing the ESR1 gene can regulate ERalpha levels through an enhancer function. Of note is the fact that the lncRNA SRA1 (steroid receptor RNA activator 1) acted as a coactivator of ERalpha, and this action depended on the phosphorylation of ERalpha at Ser118.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 27491, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The role of lncRNAs in resistance to endocrine therapy is an area of emerging interest.

Our finding of the relationship between SNPs related to the MIR2052HG lncRNA and recurrence of breast cancer in women treated with adjuvant AIs led us to perform a series of functional studies to discover potential mechanisms for this association. Using an LCL model system, we showed that, in the presence of E2, these variant SNPs increased both MIR2052HG and ESR1 expression with increased ERalpha binding to ERE motifs for variant SNP genotypes as shown by ChIP assays (Figs. 2C, 2D). However, when an AI (exemestane or anastrozole) was added, LCLs with the WT SNP genotype displayed a marked up-regulation of MIR2052HG expression and, in parallel, ESR1 expression whereas cells with the variant SNP genotypes showed a clear decrease in both MIR2052HG and ESR1 expression (Fig. 3). That is, the presence of the AI brought about a \"reversal\" of the SNP-dependent MIR2052HG expression pattern. SNP- and drug-dependent regulation of gene expression has been previously reported by our group in the case of selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs), tamoxifen and raloxifene, when given as preventive therapy, which led to the identification of novel mechanisms by which SNPs can regulate gene expression.

ERalpha plays an essential role in cell proliferation and survival in estrogen-dependent breast cancers and in AI-treated patients, ESR1 amplification, resulting in increased ERalpha expression, is associated with endocrine resistance. We showed that overexpression of MIR2052HG increased ERalpha expression and accelerated cell proliferation of MCF/AC1 cells in the presence of AI treatments (Figs. 4E, 4F).
