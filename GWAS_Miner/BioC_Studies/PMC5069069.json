Such effects are unlikely to be due to survival bias, as no correlation between age and genotype was observed (linear regression P = 0.849). These effects seem to be independent of obesity-associated insulin resistance, as associations with fasting insulin levels and HOMA-IR were not consistently observed across the cohorts (associations were stronger only in the replication cohort before adjusting for BMI). Furthermore, although the variant was associated with lower total cholesterol levels in the discovery cohort, consistent effects on serum lipid or adiponectin levels were likewise not observed.

Indeed, comparable stable overexpression of the transcripts for human wild-type and Arg457Gln CREBRF (Fig. 2a), without changing endogenous Crebrf levels (Fig. 2b), was sufficient to induce the expression of adipogenic markers (Fig. 2c-e) and promote lipid and triglyceride accumulation (Fig. 2f-h) in the absence of standard hormonal induction of adipogenesis. Although Arg457Gln CREBRF resulted in slightly weaker induction of adipogenic markers than wild-type protein (Fig. 2c,e), it promoted significantly (P < 0.02) greater lipid and triglyceride accumulation (Fig. 2f-h). To determine whether this increased energy storage was associated with decreased energy use, we next assessed glycolysis, mitochondrial respiration, and ATP production. Consistent with published data, glycolysis was suppressed and mitochondrial respiration and ATP production were enhanced by hormonally induced adipogenic differentiation (Supplementary Fig. 7). Stable overexpression of wild-type CREBRF increased whereas Arg457Gln CREBRF decreased multiple measures of cellular energy use, including basal and maximal mitochondrial respiration, mitochondrial ATP production, and basal glycolysis (Fig. 2i).

Moreover, REPTOR-knockout flies and Crebrf-knockout mice have lower total energy storage and body weight, respectively. Similarly, we found that nutrient starvation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes rapidly increased Crebrf mRNA levels, which peaked by 4 h at levels 13-fold higher than those seen at 0 h (P = 1.1 x 10-16) and remained elevated by 5-fold at 24 h after the start of starvation (P = 4.1 x 10-14) (Fig. 3a). Treatment with rapamycin, a TORC1 inhibitor, also rapidly increased Crebrf mRNA levels, but did so to a lesser extent than starvation (Fig. 3b), indicating that additional TORC1-independent signals converge on Crebrf.

Association was assessed in both the discovery sample (Table 2 and Supplementary Table 2a) and a mega-analysis of the adults from the replication sample (Supplementary Table 2b). Although meta-analysis of properly transformed phenotypes generates more accurate P values (as in Table 1), we chose instead to carry out mega-analyses here because we were primarily interested in estimating effect sizes on the natural scale for each trait. Sex-stratified analyses were also conducted in both samples (Supplementary Table 2). Diabetics were excluded from analyses of glucose, insulin, and HOMA-IR. Because the distributions of leptin levels varied greatly for women and men, a combined-sex analysis was not conducted for this trait. Residuals for quantitative traits were generated using linear regression. Age, age2, sex, and the interactions between age and sex and between age2 and sex were initially included in sex-combined models. For glucose, insulin, HOMA-IR, adiponectin, leptin, and diabetes status, a second set of models was used that included log-transformed BMI as a covariate. Sex and age x sex interactions were not included in the sex-stratified models. In the replication mega-analysis models, polity (Samoa or American Samoa) and cohort (1990s or 2000s) were initially included in the models as well. Stepwise regression was used to reduce the number of covariates for each trait separately. For quantitative traits, residuals were tested for association using the mmscore function of GenABEL, adjusted for the empirical kinship matrix as above. Dichotomous traits were analyzed using the palogist function of ProbABEL while adjusting for covariates and empirical kinship. A Bonferroni-corrected P-value threshold of 2.17 x 10-3 was used to assess significance; this threshold is conservative, as it adjusts for 23 tests even though some traits are correlated with each other. To assess a possible survivor effect as the cause of the association between the BMI-increasing allele and decreased fasting glucose levels and risk of diabetes, we conducted linear regression of age by genotype. In the discovery sample, in regard to the association of rs373863828 with BMI, fasting glucose, fasting insulin, obesity risk, and diabetes risk, addition of the first ten 'local' principal components from Supplementary Figure 1b into the statistical models had a negligible effect on the effect estimates and statistical significance (data not shown).", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 27494, "infons": {"section_type": "METHODS", "type": "title_2"}, "text": "Expression of CREBRF in human and mouse tissues", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 27542, "infons": {"section_type": "METHODS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "For human gene expression analysis, a Human Normal cDNA Array was obtained from Origene Technologies (HMRT103 and HBRT101).

These 'unrelated' individuals were then haplotyped using SHAPEIT and were annotated with ancestral allele information using the selectionTools pipeline. Haplotype bifurcation diagrams and EHH plots were drawn using the rehh R package. The haplotype bifurcation diagram visualizes the breakdown of LD as one moves away from the core allele at the focal SNP; each branch reflects the creation of new haplotypes, and the thickness of the line reflects the number of samples with the haplotype. EHH represents the probability that two randomly chosen chromosomes are identical by descent from the focal SNP to the current position of interest. Selection at the core allele is expected to result in EHH values close to 1 in an extended region centered on the focal SNP. To measure the deviation, we used selscan to compute the iHS, which is defined as the log of the ratio of the integrated EHH for the derived allele over the integrated EHH for the ancestral allele. These values are then normalized in frequency bins across the whole genome (we used 25 bins). Note that selscan's definition of iHS differs from earlier definitions where the ancestral allele was in the numerator of the ratio. In our case, a large positive iHS indicates that a derived allele has had its frequency increase owing to selection. We computed an approximate two-sided P value under the assumption that after normalization the iHS is approximately distributed as a standard normal. We also used selscan to compute nSL scores (the number of segregation sites by length). The nSL is similar to the iHS, but instead of integrating over genetic distance the nSL uses the number of segregating sites as a measure of 'distance'. Thus, the nSL is more robust to demographic assumptions than the iHS, as it does not depend on a genetic map. As with the iHS, we normalized the nSL scores in 25 frequency bins across the whole genome and computed approximate two-sided P values assuming a standard normal distribution. The selscan program was run using its assumed default values. As we were focused on testing whether there is positive selection at the missense variant, we did not adjust the P values for multiple testing.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 36295, "infons": {"section_type": "SUPPL", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "Supplementary Material", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 36318, "infons": {"section_type": "SUPPL", "type": "footnote"}, "text": "URLs.

Statistical analysis: one-way ANOVA and two-sided Bonferroni post-hoc tests. **P = 0.002, ***P < 1 x 10-11 compared to cells at 0 h; #P = 0.02, ###P = 8.8 x 10-13 compared to cells at 24 h (refed). (c,d) 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were either untransfected (UT) or transfected with plasmid encoding eGFP-only negative control, wild-type human CREBRF, or Arg457Gln CREBRF and starved. (c) Time course of 3T3-L1 cell survival upon starvation up to 24 h. (d) Cell death rates after 0-6 h of starvation. Values are given as means +- s.e.m. from two transfection replicates with six wells for each transfection and three technical (cell counting) replicates (n = 2 x 6 x 3 = 36). This experiment was performed once following a pilot experiment with fewer time points showing similar results.
