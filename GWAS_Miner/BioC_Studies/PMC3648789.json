We measured 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) levels in serum collected at the time of enrollment and at year 4 in 572 Caucasian children with asthma, who were part of a multi-center clinical trial, the Childhood Asthma Management Program. Replication was performed in a second cohort of 592 asthmatics from Costa Rica and a third cohort of 516 Puerto Rican asthmatics. In addition, we attempted replication of three SNPs that were previously identified in a large GWAS of Caucasian individuals. The setting included data from a clinical trial of childhood asthmatics and two cohorts of asthmatics recruited for genetic studies of asthma. The main outcome measure was circulating 25(OH)D levels. The 25(OH)D levels at the two time-points were only modestly correlated with each other (intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.33) in the CAMP population. We identified SNPs that were nominally associated with 25(OH)D levels at two time-points in CAMP, and replicated four SNPs in the Costa Rican cohort: rs11002969, rs163221, rs1678849, and rs4864976.

As such, excluding supplementation, food is not the primary way that we receive the necessary quantities of vitamin D. Sun exposure is one of the primary mechanisms by which we receive large amounts of vitamin D. Specifically, 7-dehydrocholesterol (7-DHC) is distributed in the skin and after exposure to sunlight, 7-DHC is converted to previtamin D3, which is then transformed to vitamin D3 by a thermally induced isomerization. Vitamin D3 then undergoes hydroxylation in the liver to 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 (henceforth, 25(OH)D) and then in the kidney to its biologically active form 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25[OH]2D).

First, the sample size of our initial and replication populations are underpowered given that we are testing over 500,000 SNPs. Secondly, in the analysis, we required that all genetic associations were nominally significant in the four analyses including both family-based and population-based analyses at baseline and year 4. Our intention of doing this was to identify genetic associations that are robust, and therefore limit the number of false positive findings. Although this approach is effective in limiting false positive associations, it is likely that we missed true genetic associations. This is likely what we observed with the SNP, rs2282679, previously reported by Wang et al. In our analysis, this SNP had a very strong association in both the baseline and year 4 population-based analyses; however, it did not reach nominal significance in one of the family-based association analyses and therefore was not selected to be replicated in the top 50 SNPs. A better strategy would be to use a more liberal threshold for the family-based analysis, as these analyses are underpowered. Third, these findings are investigating genetic associations with vitamin D in general; however, the probands used in this analysis were ascertained for asthma. This can complicate the interpretation of some of the association, as there is evidence implicating vitamin D in the development of asthma. Significant associations between polymorphisms in the VDR gene with asthma have been reported in several genetic association studies, but has not been consistently replicated. Since research suggests that genetic variants for vitamin D may also influence asthma affection status, the association results that we have observed must be interpreted with caution, as these associations may be specific to asthmatic individuals. In particular, children with asthma may have different behaviors with regard to sun exposure than a sample from the general population.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 27879, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "In conclusion, we have performed a GWAS analysis on vitamin D in three independent samples of asthmatic individuals. We identified four SNPs that had consistent genetic associations in the first two cohorts, but not the third cohort. In addition, we performed analyses to verify the top three SNPs that were identified in the previously reported GWAS of vitamin D, with replication of the findings in the top SNP (rs2282679) from that analysis; there was weak evidence for replication of the second SNP (rs10741657). Therefore, we have confirmed the association of the GC SNP from prior GWAS studies.
