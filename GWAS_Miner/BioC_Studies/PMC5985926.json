See Table 2 for further details. Of note is the neurogenesis pathway, a hypothesis of which exists for depression (and to a lesser extent, anxiety) based on stress reducing neurogenesis in the hippocampus and on the action of antidepressants on brain circuitry. Further, variants in PLXNA2, potentially involved in adult neurogenesis, have been associated with anxiety and neuroticism. Cell adhesion molecules have been implicated in neuropsychiatric disorder, and protocadherins specifically with neuroticism and risk of mood disorder, which supports the importance of cell adhesion pathways. A further gene-set analysis of genes expressing proteins that can bind to anti-depressant drug molecules was significant (P = .005) re-affirming the dependency of neuroticism and depression on shared biological pathways. This is consistent, for example, with findings for CRHR1 (highlighted in our SNP and gene-based analysis), a gene involved in normal hormonal responses to stress (the glucocorticoid pathway being a relevant and well-known target) and associated with anxiety, depression and neuroticism. That genes influencing neuroticism reveal pathways involved in currently prescribed and effective antidepressant action suggests that neuroticism could be a potentially useful clinical stratifying factor for effective antidepressant action. There may also be clinical utility in knowing a person's level of neuroticism after the occurrence of a stressful life event and therefore pre-empting onset of depression via drug therapy in those high in neuroticism.
