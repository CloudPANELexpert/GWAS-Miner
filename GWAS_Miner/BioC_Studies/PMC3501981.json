Monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) is a member of the cysteine-cysteine (CC) chemokine family and is increased in obesity. The purpose of this study was to identify loci regulating serum MCP-1 in obese Hispanic children from the Viva La Familia Study. A genome-wide association (GWA) analysis was performed in 815 children, ages 4-19 years, using genotypes assayed with the Illumina HumanOmni1-Quad v1.0 BeadChips. All analyses were performed in SOLAR using a linear regression-based test under an additive model of allelic effect, while accounting for the relatedness of family members via a kinship variance component. The strongest association for MCP-1 levels was found with a non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), rs12075 resulting in an amino acid substitution (Asp42Gly) in the Duffy antigen receptor for chemokines (DARC) gene product (minor allele frequency = 43.6%, p = 1.3 x 10-21) on chromosome 1. Four other DARC SNPs were also significantly associated with MCP-1 levels(p < 10-16-10-6). The Asp42Gly variant was associated with higher levels of MCP-1 and accounted for approximately 10% of its variability. In addition, MCP-1 levels were significantly associated with SNPs in chemokine receptor 3 (CCR3) and caspase recruitment domain family, member 9 (CARD9). In summary, the association of the DARC Asp42Gly variant with MCP-1 levels replicates previous GWA results substantiating a potential role for DARC in the regulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 1805, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "INTRODUCTION", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 1818, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Obesity is a major contributor to and precedes several metabolic disorders such as insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, hyperglycemia and hypertension. Obesity is characterized as a chronic low inflammatory state. Chemokines and proinflammatory cytokines and hormones released by adipose tissue underlie the chronic inflammatory profile associated with obesity. Chemokines and their receptors play a crucial role in directing the movement of leukocytes throughout the body contributing to adaptive immune response and the pathogenesis of a variety of diseases including atherosclerosis, diabetes and obesity. The largest family of chemokines consists of cysteine-cysteine (CC) chemokines that attract mononuclear cells to sites of chronic inflammation. Monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1) or chemokine CC ligand 2 (CCL2) is the most thoroughly characterized CC chemokine and is central to the inflammatory process. MCP-1 is produced mainly in endothelial and smooth cells. MCP-1 is involved in the recruitment of leukocytes to sites of inflammation, promotion of angiogenesis and maturation of immune cells. Its levels are elevated in a broad spectrum of chronic inflammatory diseases including obesity, insulin resistance, sepsis, cancer, autoimmune diseases and atherosclerosis. Other CC chemokines include macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1 (CCL3), MIP-1 (CCL4), and RANTES (CCL5). A second family of chemokines consists of CXC chemokines such as interleukin-8 (CXCL8) which attracts polymorphonuclear leukocytes to sites of acute inflammation.

Expression of CCR2 in adipose tissue was observed to be increased in obese individuals and associated with systemic inflammation. However, CC2R is not the only receptor for MCP-1; another receptor, Duffy antigen receptor for chemokines (DARC), mediates the interactions of MCP-1 with erythrocytes and endothelial cells.
