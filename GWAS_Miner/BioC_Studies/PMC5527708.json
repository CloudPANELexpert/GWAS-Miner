However, SNP rs12936231 (which has a minor allele frequency=0.44-0.46 in our cohorts) was non-significantly associated with asthma in our meta-analysis (P = 2.0x10-6) and is only in moderate LD (r2 >0.51) with our top SNP (rs907092) in IKZF3. This suggests that other functional polymorphisms on chromosome 17q21 may affect asthma risk in Puerto Ricans, likely through changes in expression of ORMDL3 (shown to cause experimental asthma in a transgenic murine model), GSDMB, or ZPBP2. Another SNP located within the promoter region of ZPBP2 (rs4795397, P=3.7 x 10-12 in our meta-analysis [Table S1]) is a putative functional polymorphism that shows asthma-associated allele specific nucleosome occupancy. However, the SNP's strong influence on ZPBP2 promoter activity is masked by DNA methylation of exon 1 of this gene. In contrast, the ORMDL3 promoter is fully unmethylated. The ZPBP2 and ORMDL3 genes show allelic differences in expression. It has been shown that the IKZF3-ZPBP2-GSDMB-ORMDL3 haplotype acts differently in regulation of transcripts between Europeans and Africans, with a stronger association in Europeans than in Africans. In a study by Verlaan et al., SNP rs8067378 was the most significant cis-eQTL in this four-gene region in both Europeans (P = 1.1x10-18) and Africans (P = 4.3x10-9). In an eQTL study in Puerto Ricans using our Hartford-PR dataset, the same SNP was also the most significant cis-eQTL (P = 2.6x10-10) in the four-gene region. Although the two studies might not be comparable due to different statistical models and different tissues (i.e., LCL used in the Verlaan et al. study and globin-cleaned whole blood used in the Chen et al. study), we speculate that the significance of associated SNPs with expression in Puerto Ricans is between Europeans and Africans, since these are two ancestral populations in Puerto Ricans. We further performed eQTL analyses between our top SNP (rs907092) and expression of the IKZF3-ZPBP2-GSDMB-ORMDL3 locus using whole-blood RNA microarray data (n=121) from the Hartford-PR study. Findings from this secondary analysis, conducted using linear regression and adjusting for age, gender, asthma status, study site and the first two PCs, suggest that our top SNP (rs907092) may regulate expression of the IKZF3-ZPBP2-GSDMB-ORMDL3 locus (P = 0.07 for IKZF3, P = 0.02 for ZPBP2, P = 0.009 for GSDMB and P = 0.0004 for ORMDL3).", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 23780, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "We recognize several study limitations. First, we had insufficient statistical power to detect weak genetic effects of common SNPs (e.g., ORs between 0.9 and 1.10 for IL33) or rare susceptibility variants. Second, subjects in our study lived in different sites in the U.S. mainland and Puerto Rico, and thus environmental differences may have confounded our results despite adjustment for study site in the four component studies. However, most minor allelic frequencies and effect estimates were similar across study cohorts. Third, misclassification of COPD as asthma is possible among adults in the HCHS/SOL cohort, given that 980 (52.5%) participants were former or current smokers (mean pack-years=18.6). Such misdiagnosis could account for the less significant associations reported in HCHS/SOL, even after adjustment for cigarette smoking. In summary, our findings suggest that common allelic variants in the chromosome 17q21 locus have the greatest effects on, and are thus particularly important in, the pathogenesis of asthma in Puerto Ricans. We confirmed susceptibility variants in two previously reported genes (IL1RL1 and TLSP). Future studies should aim to characterize functional variants that cause asthma in Puerto Ricans, either through primary genetic effects or through interactions with relevant exposures (e.g., second-hand smoke and air pollution).", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 25153, "infons": {"section_type": "SUPPL", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "Supplementary Material", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 25176, "infons": {"section_type": "SUPPL", "type": "footnote"}, "text": "Author Contributions: Conception and study design: G.R.B., E.G.B., and J.C.C.; Data acquisition, analysis and interpretation: Q.Y., M.P.Y., J.B., E.F., J.L., S.O., E.A-P., C.L., M.M.C., B.A.R., A.S., T.S., D.H., S.H., C.E., M.P.C., D.R., K.R., G.C., and W.C.; and drafting of the manuscript for intellectual content: Q.Y., R.G.B., E.G.B., and J.C.C.
