ANK2 codes for ankyrin 2, a gene related to known BD susceptibility gene ANK3. Although a plausible gene for susceptibility to BD, we did not observe evidence for ANK2 in our replication sample or meta-analysis. A variant within CACNA2D1 (in the same family of voltage-dependent calcium channels as CACNA1C) was also a top ranking SNP in our stratified analysis of BD cases with BE compared to controls. Notably, the same CACNA2D1 variant was previously reported in a meta-analysis including the GAIN data, but was not reported in the original analysis. In fact the association with CACNA2D1 was not identified until the sample size was increased to 2191 cases and 1434 controls; in the present study, we elicited the same variant with a reduced sample size based on a refined subtype, emphasizing the potential increase in power to detect relevant genetic association as a result of phenotypic refinement and reduced trait variation.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 23829, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "IPA analysis revealed two main networks showing high gene/ molecule interaction. These networks involved two of our top ranked genes: APOB and CACNA2D1. Interestingly, in the same network as APOB, growth factor downstream signaling cascade molecules Akt, ERK, MAPK and Bcl-2 were linked; these molecules have been related to BD pathophysiology and are involved in mood stabilization mechanisms. Lithium acts by disinhibiting Akt, while ketamine activates Akt and ERK. Lithium and valproate increase levels of ERK in the hippocampus, and its inhibition is correlated with manic-like effects in rodents. Lower Bcl-2 expression with subsequent alterations of calcium homeostasis and glutamate dysregulation, have been identified as part of BD pathophysiology; its neuroprotective role therefore has been suggested as a potential target for future mood pharmacotherapy.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 24695, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The top ranking SNPs based on our analyses differ from those previously reported for European Americans in the GAIN data based on analyses that did not incorporate BE history. However, rs7690204 in GYPA and rs10193871 in NCKAP5 (a.k.aNAP5) reported by Smith et al. were also highly ranked in our analyses, with more extreme odds ratio estimates in our analyses (Supplementary Table S6). Furthermore, our analyses integrating additional information into the investigation of genome-wide associations with BD (through restriction to a BE subtype) generally pointed to variants with greater biological relevance, as well as results of greater significance (including lower p-values and higher odds ratios) than those reported in the original analyses. This is striking, considering that our analysis utilized a smaller sample size due to stratification and the restriction to those with available BE data. This highlights the potential advantage in increased power to detect genetic effects through the reduction of heterogeneity. By considering phenotypic subtypes, potentially important genetic factors became more readily apparent.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 25827, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "5.

Further genetic association studies in well-characterized human samples, as well as functional and longitudinal studies, may help to determine the causal pathways underlying the observed associations with this APOB sequence variant.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 26989, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Additional study limitations should be noted. Because subjects were recruited over a long time period, subsets of BD cases were given different diagnostic interviews, which were also different from those given to controls. This restricted our analyses to subsets of the full sample, precluding a thorough assessment of the relationship between BD, BE, and SNP effects and limiting the interpretation of results. For example, the BD case-only analysis of BE behavior can be used to investigate potential SNP-BE interactions, under the assumption that BE is independent of a given genetic effect; however, for some SNPs in the genome, this assumption is likely to be false, since BE is thought to be under genetic influence and may in fact share genetic factors with BD. The lack of data on BE for mentally healthy control subjects without BD impedes this investigation, because we cannot determine whether associated SNPs reflect an interaction effect on BD or whether the SNP is associated with BE independent of BD. Similarly, for variants associated with the BD+BE subtype, we are unable to determine whether the association is driven by BD, BE, or both. However, our analyses allow us to study an underlying construct that may be responsible for both mood disorders and eating behaviors; the details of the mechanism of action of identified risk factors on these phenotypes needs to be examined in subsequent studies. A final limitation is that the definition of BE used in the discovery sample was broader than that in the replication sample.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 28538, "infons": {"section_type": "CONCL", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "6.
