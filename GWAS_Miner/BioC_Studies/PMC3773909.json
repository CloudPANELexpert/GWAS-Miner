Malignant testicular germ cells are exquisitely sensitive to cisplatin, which has revolutionised the treatment of TGCT and represents one of the great successes of cancer chemotherapy. Nevertheless, it would seem most likely that the 5p15 signals are mediated through the TERT gene, which encodes the catalytic subunit of the telomerase ribonucleoprotein complex. At each division of actively dividing cells there is loss of terminal sequences. Telomerase counterbalances this by extending the TTAGGG telomeric nucleotide repeats. Telomere shortening is associated with increased genome instability and neoplasia .

Moreover, it has been observed that undifferentiated TGCTs (seminomas) exhibit the pattern of high TERT expression, high telomerase activity and long telomeres seen in normal testicular germ cells, whilst well differentiated TGCTs such as teratomas show minimal TERT expression and no telomerase activity . There is some reflection of this dichotomy in our data as the association of rs2736100 is stronger with seminomas (OR 1.48 (1.32-1.66) than non-seminomas (1.26(1.12-1.42), (P=0.04)) (see Methods and Supplementary Tables 7 and 8).", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 9267, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Telomerase regulation is also implicated in underlying the association of the locus on chromosome 12p13.

The strongest evidence comes from mouse studies which demonstrated that DMRT1 deficiency is associated with testicular cancer: 90% of Dmrt1 -/- 129Sv mice developed teratomas compared to <1% of Dmrt1+/+ mice. DMRT1 is a transcription factor with a highly conserved DNA-binding motif. Phylogenetic studies suggest that, despite gross differences in sex-determining mechanisms, DMRT1 represents an ancient conserved component common to many vertebrate sex-determining pathways. The distinct cell-type-dependent, stage-dependent and sexually dimorphic expression profile of DMRT1 during embryogenesis is consistent with high DMRT1 expression being required for testicular differentiation whilst lower expression results in ovarian differentiation .

SPRY4 acts in the mitogen activated protein kinase pathway, which is activated by the KITLG/KIT system, whilst BAK1 encodes a pro-apoptotic protein, expression of which is repressed by the KITLG/KIT system in testicular germ cells.
