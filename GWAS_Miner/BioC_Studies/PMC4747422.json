Nevertheless, we identified and replicated a new genome-wide significant locus at 12q12 (Table 1). This new SLE signal falls within an intergenic region, located ~147 kb 5'-upstream of PRICKLE1 [prickle homolog 1 (Drosophila)] and ~1 Mb 5'-upstream of IRAK4 (interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 4) (Figure 1). This region also harbors some lincRNA genes that reside in closer vicinity to this SLE signal (Figure 1-bottom panel). Non-coding RNAs are emerging as essential regulators of various cellular processes including immune response. Although these recently described lincRNAs do not seem to be represented in public gene expression databases (Genevar and BioGPS), in silico assessment of eQTL and mQTL associations and expression of relevant protein-coding genes (Figures S3-S8) suggest that this new locus probably functions as a distal regulatory element (i.e., enhancer) for the expression of neighboring genes in a tissue/cell type-specific manner, with indication of epigenetic modulation. The association of SLE-relevant SNPs with surrounding methylation sites is particularly strong at this new locus (Figure S6) and these sites may modulate chromatin accessibility and transcriptional potential of underlying DNA segment. Recent studies suggest that inter-individual variation in DNA methylation is genetically regulated (more variable and heritable for gene-body and intergenic methylation sites) and these regulatory variants usually function in a tissue-specific manner.

PRICKLE1 (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/144165) encodes a nuclear receptor that regulates the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway. This pathway was (a) implicated in renal disease pathogenesis including lupus nephritis in mice, (b) shown to be activated in most autoimmune diseases, and (c) reported to play a critical role in senescence of bone marrow-mesenchymal stem cells from SLE patients. PRICKLE1 mutations were linked to epilepsy and Autism Spectrum Disorders. PPHLN1 (Periphilin 1; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/51535) appears to play a role in epithelial differentiation and epidermal integrity; however, it is most abundantly expressed in immune cells (Figure S7), thus awaiting further functional characterization. IRAK4 (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/51135) is involved in NF-kappaB activation in Toll-like receptor and T-cell receptor signaling pathways and its mutations were reported to cause recurrent infections. IRAK4 was shown to play an important role in Th17-mediated immunity and removal of autoreactive B cells.

Additional large studies are also necessary to examine association of this new locus with SLE subphenotypes and its interaction with hormonal and environmental factors.
