There are limitations to candidate gene studies, including the need for a priori hypotheses and subjective decisions in what genes to examine. Another method used to study genetic associations are genome wide association studies (GWAS), which use an unbiased approach to provide an evaluation of common genetic variation across the genome and can identify genetic risk loci. To date, there have been no GWAS with emotion dysregulation. However, a number of recent studies performed with major psychiatric disorders have shown evidence of cross-disorder risk genes. As part of the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (PGC), the largest genome-wide analysis of psychiatric illness thus far, investigators found initial evidence that specific SNPs are significantly associated with cross-disorder risk of both childhood-onset and adult-onset psychiatric conditions. The investigators also examined shared genetic etiology and found evidence for shared genetic variation across schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, autism spectrum disorders, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. In addition, a meta-analysis of GWAS studies for neuroticism, a personality trait characterized by strong negative emotions and associated with emotion dysregulation, found evidence for a genetic locus that has been associated with major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia.

To reduce bias, we applied a statistical method to identify overrepresented pathways in a single GWAS dataset. Analyses were conducted using WebGestalt (http://bioinfo.vanderbilt.edu/webgestalt/), a web-based gene set analysis toolkit which uses genes as the input. It incorporates published information about biochemical pathways taken from the MolecularSignatures Database (MSigDB; http://software.broadinstitute.org/gsea/msigdb/index.jsp). We first used Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) which was developed for microarray gene expression analysis but has also been used for GWAS. Using the male sample GWAS SNPs, we included the genes for all SNPs with a cut-off p-value of 1x10-4. Even if more than one SNP was identified for a gene, the gene was only included in the analysis once. Then, we ran a disease enrichment analysis, which examined the list of genes identified through GSEA against a database of genes that past research has found to be associated with specific diseases and provides a list of disease pathways that are \"over-represented\" by the identified list of genes from MSigDB curated gene sets (http://software.broadinstitute.org/gsea/msigdb/index.jsp). It then compares the number of genes in the above list that are on a given disease to the total number of genes on the pathway overall. More specifically, GSEA takes an a prioi set of genes S, and determines whether the members of S are randomly distributed through L or primarily found at the top or bottom. An \"enrichment score\" (ES) is calculated to determine the degree to which a set S is overrepresented at the extremes (top or bottom) of the entire ranked list L; this is calculated with a running-sum statistic of \"hits\" (when S genes are present in L) and \"misses\" (genes encountered in L that are not in S): Phit - Pmiss. Statistical significance of the ES is based on a permutation approach, comparing ES with ESNULL based on randomly assigned phenotypes (see for a full description of this approach and all statistical methodology).
