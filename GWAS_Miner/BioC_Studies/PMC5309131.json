Increases in HDL-C levels after statin treatment are probably partly the result of a reduction in CETP mediated lipid transfer, as was also shown in mice expressing human CETP. Statin treatment decreases CETP activity up to 30%. Previously it has been shown that genetic variants within CETP are associated with differences in CETP concentration. The three SNPs associated with HDL-C response to statins in the present study are located 2.5-7 kb upstream of the CETP gene and are in high linkage disequilibrium (Figure 3).

Several studies showed associations with a greater HDL-C response, whereas others showed no significant associations. These discrepancies could be explained by limited sample sizes and by the investigation of different genetic variants in these studies. An alternative explanation could be the fact that the effect of statins on HDL-C response is relatively small and depends on statin dose and type. Since the power to detect genetic effects on these small variations is low in single studies, the results from the present large meta-analysis, with replication, provide strong evidence that genetic variation at the CETP locus is associated with HDL-C response.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 21385, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The results of six randomized clinical trials and ten observational studies were combined in the first stage of the current study.

This and the variation in statin dosages during follow-up for an individual are a limitation of the current study, since the pharmacogenetic impact might be dependent on specific statin types and dose. To address this possible limitation, the individual study analyses were adjusted for statin equivalent dose based on effect on LDL-C levels, making the different statin types likely more comparable with respect to clinical effectiveness on HDL-C levels. Combining RCTs and observational cohort might also result in heterogeneity between the study types. To reduce the possibility of large heterogeneity we aimed to mimic the design of a RCT in the observational studies, by including only new statin-users.

In pharmacogenetic studies investigating lipid responses to drug exposure, it is important to eliminate the effect of the association between baseline lipid levels and the investigated genetic variants. To reduce the impact of these possible confounding effects, our response to treatment analyses were adjusted for baseline HDL-C levels. In addition, interaction analyses in five of the RCTs, with direct modeled comparison with a random assignment to a placebo group, suggested little or no influence of the association between the CETP SNPs and baseline HDL-C levels on the genetic effect on HDL-C response to statin treatment.

However, a recent study employing Mendelian randomization found that genotypes associated with plasma HDL-C levels were not associated with the impact on CVD risk that would be predicted by the magnitude of the genotypic effects on HDL-C.
