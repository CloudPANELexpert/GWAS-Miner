The observation of an excess of SNPs with p values approximately >=1x10-3, apparent in both Q-Q plots but particularly in that of the depression cohort, would be consistent with this model. For the effect sizes observed in our meta-analysis (i.e., odds ratio of approximately 1.2), approximately 7,000 suicide attempt cases (with matched nonattempting comparison subjects) would be required for 80% power to identify SNPs with a minor allele frequency of 20% and a p value <5x10-8. Thus, analysis of even larger cohorts, in the context of consortia such as the Psychiatric Genomewide Association Study Consortium, and consideration of alternate models of heritability:for example, using polygenic models or considering rarer variants of larger effect:may be required to identify loci that confer risk for suicide in mood disorders.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 22623, "infons": {"section_type": "SUPPL", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "Supplementary Material", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 22646, "infons": {"section_type": "SUPPL", "type": "footnote"}, "text": "All other authors report no financial relationships with commercial interests.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 22725, "infons": {"section_type": "REF", "type": "title"}, "text": "References", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 22736, "infons": {"fpage": "844", "lpage": "850", "name_0": "surname:Osby;given-names:U", "name_1": "surname:Brandt;given-names:L", "name_2": "surname:Correia;given-names:N", "name_3": "surname:Ekbom;given-names:A", "name_4": "surname:Sparen;given-names:P", "pub-id_pmid": "11545667", "section_type": "REF", "source": "Arch Gen Psychiatry", "type": "ref", "volume": "58", "year": "2001"}, "text": "Excess mortality in bipolar and unipolar disorder in Sweden", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 22796, "infons": {"fpage": "584", "lpage": "596", "name_0": "surname:Brodsky;given-names:BS", "name_1": "surname:Mann;given-names:JJ", "name_10": "surname:Melhem;given-names:NM", "name_11": "surname:Brent;given-names:D", "name_2": "surname:Stanley;given-names:B", "name_3": "surname:Tin;given-names:A", "name_4": "surname:Oquendo;given-names:M", "name_5": "surname:Birmaher;given-names:B", "name_6": "surname:Greenhill;given-names:L", "name_7": "surname:Kolko;given-names:D", "name_8": "surname:Zelazny;given-names:J", "name_9": "surname:Burke;given-names:AK", "pub-id_pmid": "18373384", "section_type": "REF", "source": "J Clin Psychiatry", "type": "ref", "volume": "69", "year": "2008"}, "text": "Familial transmission of suicidal behavior factors mediating the relationship between childhood abuse and offspring suicide attempts", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 22929, "infons": {"fpage": "1145", "lpage": "1152", "name_0": "surname:Brent;given-names:DA", "name_1": "surname:Bridge;given-names:J", "name_2": "surname:Johnson;given-names:BA", "name_3": "surname:Connolly;given-names:J", "pub-id_pmid": "8956681", "section_type": "REF", "source": "Arch Gen Psychiatry", "type": "ref", "volume": "53", "year": "1996"}, "text": "Suicidal behavior runs in families a controlled family study of adolescent suicide victims", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 23020, "infons": {"fpage": "18", "lpage": "24", "name_0": "surname:Johnson;given-names:BA", "name_1": "surname:Brent;given-names:DA", "name_2": "surname:Bridge;given-names:J", "name_3": "surname:Connolly;given-names:J", "section_type": "REF", "source": "Acta Psychiatr Scands", "type": "ref", "volume": "97", "year": "1998"}, "text": "The familial aggregation of adolescent suicide attempts", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 23076, "infons": {"fpage": "360", "lpage": "365", "name_0": "surname:Cheng;given-names:AT", "name_1": "surname:Chen;given-names:TH", "name_2": "surname:Chen;given-names:CC", "name_3": "surname:Jenkins;given-names:R", "pub-id_pmid": "11116779", "section_type": "REF", "source": "Br J Psychiatry", "type": "ref", "volume": "177", "year": "2000"}, "text": "Psychosocial psychiatric risk factors for suicide case-control psychological autopsy study", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 23167, "infons": {"fpage": "1368", "lpage": "1376", "name_0": "surname:Schulze;given-names:TG", "name_1": "surname:Hedeker;given-names:D", "name_2": "surname:Zandi;given-names:P", "name_3": "surname:Rietschel;given-names:M", "name_4": "surname:McMahon;given-names:FJ", "pub-id_pmid": "17146011", "section_type": "REF", "source": "Arch Gen Psychiatry", "type": "ref", "volume": "63", "year": "2006"}, "text": "What is familial about familial bipolar disorder?
