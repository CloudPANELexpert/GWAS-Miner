The CEP72 gene encodes a centrosomal protein that is essential for microtubule formation, and vincristine exerts its pharmacologic effects by inhibiting microtubule formation. We found that the CEP72 variant associated with vincristine neuropathy (T allele at rs924607) creates a binding site for a transcriptional repressor, leading to lower CEP72 mRNA expression, and we showed that reducing the expression of CEP72 in human iPSC neurons or leukemia cells increased their sensitivity to vincristine. Because vincristine-induced toxicities can be influenced by cumulative dosage of vincristine and differ by race, we included both cumulative dosage and ancestry as covariates in our analyses, revealing that the CEP72 rs924607SNP was the only SNP reaching genome-wide significance (<5x10-8) in its association with vincristine-induced neuropathy. The frequency of the risk allele (T) was lower in African-American patients compared to the other racial groups, consistent with its lower frequency in African ancestry samples in the Hapmap collection. This finding is also consistent with the reported lower incidence of vincristine-induced neuropathy in black patients. We found that children who inherited two copies of the CEP72 risk allele (homozygous for T at rs924607) had a significantly higher incidence of vincristine-induced peripheral neuropathy (60.8% [95% CI 43.9%-77.6% in TT patients compared to 23.4% [95% CI 17.4%-29.4] in CC/CT patients).

In the current study, patients received uniform treatment according to prospective clinical trials, with neuropathy assessed by NCI criteria to prospectively identify all patients who developed grades 2-4 neuropathy during continuation therapy with vincristine. Although a genetic component of vincristine-induced neuropathy would be consistent with previously reported racial differences in the incidence of vincristine-induced neuropathy, previous candidate gene studies have not yielded reproducible findings.
