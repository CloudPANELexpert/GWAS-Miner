These new genetic findings further implicate the involvement of the IL-23-IL-23R-IL-17 pathway in ankylosing spondylitis. Although further studies will be required to identify the true disease-associated variants, each associated locus contains candidate genes of strong biological interest in ankylosing spondylitis, which are discussed below. IL12B encodes IL12p40, which is a shared component of both IL-12 and IL-23. Association has previously been reported between SNPs in IL23R and ankylosing spondylitis. SNPs in or near CARD9 and PTGER4 (encoding prostaglandin E receptor 4, EP4 subtype) have also been associated with Crohn's disease previously, and variants within IL12B and IL23R have been associated with both Crohn's disease and psoriasis. PGE2 acts through PTGER4 to induce the production of IL-23 and IL-17 and to promote expansion of TH17 lymphocyte counts; TH17 lymphocyte counts and IL-17 levels are both known to be elevated in ankylosing spondylitis. Consistent with this, we observed upregulation of PTGER4 expression in spondyloarthritis synovium. CARD9 mediates signals from dectin-1 and -2, which are innate immunity receptors for beta-glucan, a component of fungal and some bacterial cell walls. beta-glucan induces PGE2 production, which in turn promotes the expansion of TH17 cells. We and others have recently reported that SKG mice treated with beta-glucan develop spondyloarthritis and Crohn's disease; this mouse model is characterized by TH17 activation. These findings are thus consistent with a model of human ankylosing spondylitis in which ubiquitous pathogens carrying beta-glucan induce disease by stimulating the IL-23-IL-23R-IL-17 pathway.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 15392, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Despite considerable research since the discovery of the association of HLA-B27 with ankylosing spondylitis in the early 1970s, the mechanism explaining the involvement of HLA-B27 with the disease is unclear.

A further possible hypothesis is that HLA-B27 acts as a tag for another, nearby, true susceptibility allele. Our findings that no other MHC SNP was more strongly associated with ankylosing spondylitis than rs4349859 or HLA-B27 indicate that this 'linked gene' theory is unlikely.

HLA-B27-and ERAP1-negative disease is unlikely to be caused by a similar mechanism, and the fact that overexpression of TNF alone is sufficient to cause spondyloarthritis in mice suggests that overexpression or signaling by pro-inflammatory cytokines alone may be sufficient to cause ankylosing spondylitis. Although the findings of our studies of ERAP1 function using recombinant ERAP1 protein require much further experimental validation, they suggest that ERAP1 influences disease risk in ankylosing spondylitis, with associated, non-ancestral alleles reducing the disease risk by a mechanism involving reduced peptide trimming and, likely as a consequence, altered peptide presentation by HLA-B27.
