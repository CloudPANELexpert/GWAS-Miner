Our findings are in tune with President Obama's announcement of the Precision Medicine Initiative, which will include enrollment of at least one million Americans. The goal of this Initiative is to begin a new era of biomedical research that centers on the inclusion of study populations for common disease reflecting the demographic and genetic diversity of U.S. patient populations. As citizens and scientists, we must leverage our skills to ensure that our research furthers this goal and moves us closer to the development of therapies that will improve care in all patients.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 22439, "infons": {"section_type": "SUPPL", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "Supplementary Material", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 22462, "infons": {"section_type": "SUPPL", "type": "footnote"}, "text": "Disclosure", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 22473, "infons": {"section_type": "SUPPL", "type": "footnote"}, "text": "The rest of authors report no conflicts of interest in this work.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 22539, "infons": {"section_type": "REF", "type": "title"}, "text": "References", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 22550, "infons": {"name_0": "surname:Acock;given-names:AC", "section_type": "REF", "source": "A Gentle Introduction to Stata", "type": "ref", "year": "2014"}, "text": "", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 22551, "infons": {"fpage": "396", "lpage": "406", "name_0": "surname:Akhabir;given-names:L", "name_1": "surname:Sandford;given-names:AJ", "pub-id_pmid": "21276132", "section_type": "REF", "source": "Respirology", "type": "ref", "volume": "16", "year": "2011"}, "text": "Genome-wide association studies for discovery of genes involved in asthma.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 22626, "infons": {"fpage": "547 e5", "lpage": "553", "name_0": "surname:Akinbami;given-names:LJ", "name_1": "surname:Moorman;given-names:JE", "name_2": "surname:Simon;given-names:AE", "name_3": "surname:Schoendorf;given-names:KC", "pub-id_pmid": "25091437", "section_type": "REF", "source": "J Allergy Clin Immunol", "type": "ref", "volume": "134", "year": "2014"}, "text": "Trends in racial disparities for asthma outcomes among children 0 to 17 years, 2001-2010.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 22716, "infons": {"fpage": "1655", "lpage": "64", "name_0": "surname:Alexander;given-names:DH", "name_1": "surname:Novembre;given-names:J", "name_2": "surname:Lange;given-names:K", "pub-id_pmid": "19648217", "section_type": "REF", "source": "Genome Res", "type": "ref", "volume": "19", "year": "2009"}, "text": "Fast model-based estimation of ancestry in unrelated individuals.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 22782, "infons": {"fpage": "64", "lpage": "5", "name_0": "surname:Barnes;given-names:PJ", "pub-id_pmid": "11686866", "section_type": "REF", "source": "Respir Res", "type": "ref", "volume": "2", "year": "2001"}, "text": "Th2 cytokines and asthma: an introduction.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 22825, "infons": {"fpage": "697", "lpage": "702", "name_0": "surname:Borrell;given-names:LN", "name_1": "surname:Nguyen;given-names:EA", "name_10": "surname:Lenoir;given-names:MA", "name_11": "surname:Lurmann;given-names:F", "name_12": "surname:Meade;given-names:K", "name_13": "surname:Serebrisky;given-names:D", "name_14": "surname:Rodriguez-Cintron;given-names:W", "name_15": "surname:Kumar;given-names:R", "name_16": "surname:Rodriguez-Santana;given-names:JR", "name_17": "surname:Thyne;given-names:SM", "name_18": "surname:Burchard;given-names:EG", "name_2": "surname:Roth;given-names:LA", "name_3": "surname:Oh;given-names:SS", "name_4": "surname:Tcheurekdjian;given-names:H", "name_5": "surname:Sen;given-names:S", "name_6": "surname:Davis;given-names:A", "name_7": "surname:Farber;given-names:HJ", "name_8": "surname:Avila;given-names:PC", "name_9": "surname:Brigino-Buenaventura;given-names:E", "pub-id_pmid": "23392439", "section_type": "REF", "source": "Am J Respir Crit Care Med", "type": "ref", "volume": "187", "year": "2013"}, "text": "Childhood obesity and asthma control in the GALA II and SAGE II studies.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 22898, "infons": {"fpage": "301", "lpage": "2", "name_0": "surname:Burchard;given-names:EG", "pub-id_pmid": "25230631", "section_type": "REF", "source": "Nature", "type": "ref", "volume": "513", "year": "2014"}, "text": "Medical research: Missing patients.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 22934, "infons": {"fpage": "514", "lpage": "21", "name_0": "surname:Burchard;given-names:EG", "name_1": "surname:Oh;given-names:SS", "name_2": "surname:Foreman;given-names:MG", "name_3": "surname:Celedon;given-names:JC", "pub-id_pmid": "25584658", "section_type": "REF", "source": "Am J Respir Crit Care Med", "type": "ref", "volume": "191", "year": "2015"}, "text": "Moving toward true inclusion of racial/ethnic minorities in federally funded studies.
