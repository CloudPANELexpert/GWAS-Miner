For example, the top-ranked SNPs in NME8, ABCA7, and CASS4 (Supplementary Table 2) were nominally significant in EAs and AAs, but the referent allele was associated with increased risk in one group and decreased risk in the other. One explanation for these differences is that the SNPs are tagging different functional variants across groups. This idea is consistent with our findings from gene-based tests showing that the constellation of variants contributing to the association with some genes was different across ethnic groups. Alternatively, when examining a large number of variants it is expected that a few will show nominal significance in opposite directions among groups.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 21201, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "There are several limitations associated with our study. The sample size imbalance between the EAs and the other populations weakened the opportunity to identify association patterns that may be unique to the non-EA groups. The small size of the non-EA groups also reduced power to detect novel gene associations if the functional variants (and the SNPs that tag them) differ among ethnic groups. An additional weakness is the lack of replication samples for the non-EA populations. Despite these limitations, our study highlights the importance of investigating the genetic architecture for AD in ethnically diverse populations.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 21831, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Our findings warrant further replication in independent samples, deep sequencing and bioinformatics studies to identify the potentially functional variants, and experimental validation.
