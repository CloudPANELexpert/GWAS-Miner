"Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a common disease with both genetic and environmental contributors. In our study, we identified 2 additional DNA sequence variants that contribute to VTE risk. At the current time, at least 14 DNA sequence variants across the genome have been shown to confer risk for VTE. We demonstrate that a subset of these appear to contribute to coronary artery disease risk as well. Lastly, obesity has been implicated as an independent epidemiologic risk factor for VTE, however, whether this association reflects a causal relationship has been unclear. We found that human genetic evidence supports a causal role for obesity in risk for VTE. Future efforts to decrease obesity may prove effective in reducing risk for VTE.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}], "annotations": [], "relations": []}]}
