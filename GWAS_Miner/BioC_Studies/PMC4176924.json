In the current analysis of moderate-to-severe disease, rs7937 (nearest gene, RAB4B) was just below genome-wide significance (6 2x10-); however, the association was genome-wide significant (1 0x10-9) in a model adjusting only for principal components of genetic ancestry, and more significant when limited to non-Hispanic whites. A recent study in a Japanese population confirmed an association with smoking behavior with SNPs in this region, and additional analyses of nicotine addiction and lung eQTLs suggest effects at this locus may be mediated through several different variants in CYP2A6 as well as EGLN2 . Together, these data suggest effects of the 19q13 locus on COPD act through a mechanism involving cigarette smoking, and are complex, potentially in the presence of locus heterogeneity across populations.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 23188, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Our gene-based analysis using VEGAS identified an association with APOBR, the apolipoprotein B receptor.

Thus, we also examined the case-control results only in the African-Americans.

These data are consistent with a prior report finding little evidence that the relationship of smoking to lung function differed by genetic ancestry, as well as genetic studies of other traits that have demonstrated overall similarities of loci shared between ethnically diverse groups. While these results support our decision to combine the African-Americans and non-Hispanic whites to improve statistical power, our results should not be interpreted to imply including other ethnic groups is generally redundant; indeed, genetic studies in specific ethnic groups have led to discovery of novel loci and provided important information for identifying specific variants at individual loci.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 24862, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Our study does not address other genetic contributors to COPD susceptibility. We did not, for example, consider gene-gene interactions or gene-environment interaction. The genotyping and imputation in this study are not well-suited to address the role of rare variants, which may also be important in explaining COPD susceptibility. Our definition of cases and controls was based only on the presence of moderate, or moderate-to-severe airflow obstruction, yet COPD is highly heterogeneous. Analysis of individual characteristics (e.g. emphysema) or of specific subtypes (e.g. severe disease, as we demonstrate here; radiographically defined subsets; or separate GOLD categories) may provide greater insight into the development of this complex and heterogeneous disease. Well-powered studies of lung function in the general population, as well as COPD ascertained through population-based studies, have not identified several of the loci reported here. Additional studies will be helpful in determining whether heterogeneity in COPD definitions, including varying degrees of severity and case ascertainment, differential effects of genetic variants in disease versus lung function in the general population, or Type 1 or Type 2 error could account for these discrepancies. The number of loci achieving genome-wide significance described here for COPD is few compared to other complex diseases, and the markers described here account for a very small fraction of the estimated heritability.

In addition, cumulative effects of these loci may be substantial. Although more accurate risk prediction estimates will require assessments in independent populations, the increased odds of 1 24 with each COPD GWAS risk allele in the COPDGene population suggest that harboring three risk alleles could nearly double odds of moderate to severe COPD. By comparison, the population-based BOLD study estimated an odds ratio for COPD per ten pack-years of smoking from1 16 to 1 28.
