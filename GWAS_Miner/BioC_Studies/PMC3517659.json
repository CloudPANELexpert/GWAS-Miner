Briefly, we selected groups of SNPs based on their level of association with asthma in the GABRIEL analysis (for example, SNPs with a P <= 5x10-7) and created a quantitative score of genetic load based on these SNPs for every individual included in the Australian GWAS, after restricting the sample to 2,082 patients with asthma and 2,211 controls genotyped with the 610K array and that did not overlap with those included in the GABRIEL. This genetic score was calculated as the weighted sum of the number of reference alleles for each genotyped SNP, with the weight corresponding to the effect size (log of the odds ratio [OR]) estimated for that marker in the GABRIEL study. We then used logistic regression to test the association between a specific genetic score and case-control asthma status in our study. The log of the odds ratio was selected as the weight (instead of, for example, simply counting the number of risk alleles) because it considers both the expected magnitude and direction of effect of an individual SNP. We used the odds ratio estimated in the GABRIEL study because currently that study represents the largest asthma GWAS done so far, hence providing the most accurate estimates of SNP effects available for asthma.

Importantly, this list did not include any SNP located near (<500 kb) the ten GABRIEL loci, PDE4D, DENND1B, IL6R or 11q13.5.

Multiple lines of evidence suggest that IL6R is indeed the causal gene underlying our observed association with rs4129267. First, rs4129267 is strongly associated with variation in serum concentration of the soluble form of the IL-6 receptor (sIL-6R). Each copy of the rs4129267:T allele increases sIL-6R protein concentration by about 1.4-fold, while it increases the risk of asthma by 1.09-fold based on our analyses. Second, the concentration of sIL-6R is increased in both the serum and airways of patients with asthma, and it correlates with Th2 cytokine production in the lung. Lastly, selective blockade of sIL-6R in mice suppressed IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13 production and decreased eosinophil numbers in the lung; on the other hand, blockade of sIL6-R plus the membrane-bound form of the receptor (mIL-6R) caused not only the suppression of Th2 cytokine production but also expansion of CD4+CD25+ Tregs in the lung with increased IL-10 production and suppressive capacity. Thus, together with our results, these data suggest that rs4129267, or a causal variant in linkage disequilibrium with it, increases the risk of developing asthma by up-regulating protein concentrations of sIL-6R or mIL-6R, or both, which in turn contributes to the development and maintenance of a Th2 immune response in the lung. An IL-6R antagonist (tocilizumab) has been approved as an effective biologic drug to treat rheumatoid arthritis; further studies are warranted to test the hypothesis that tocilizumab might also be effective to treat asthma, particularly for patients with the rs4129267:T risk variant.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 25133, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The second locus that our analyses implicate in the causation of asthma is represented by rs7130588, which is located on chromosome 11q13.5 near a SNP recently reported to associate with two immune-related diseases, Crohn's disease (CD) and atopic dermatitis (AD). The variant reported to associate with Crohn's disease and atopic dermatitis (rs7927894) is in complete linkage disequilibrium (LD) (r2 = 1) with rs7130588, and the two predisposing alleles (rs7927894:T and rs7130588:G) occur on the same haplotype. This indicates that the same underlying causal variant is likely to explain the association between this locus and the three diseases. Each copy of the rs7130588:G allele increases the risk of atopic dermatitis by 1.22-fold, Crohn's disease by 1.16-fold and asthma in our study by 1.09-fold. The association with atopic dermatitis and our finding that rs7130588:G does not seem to increase asthma risk in non-atopic individuals collectively suggests that this allele directly increases the risk of allergic sensitisation and, if this develops, it increases the risk of subsequently developing asthma. This mechanism is consistent with the epidemiological observations that sensitization, eczema and allergic rhinitis often precede the development of asthma symptoms. While this work was under review, Marenholz and colleagues also reported an association between 11q13.5 and asthma, although not at the genome-wide significance level. Results from that study are also consistent with an effect for the 11q13.5 locus that is specific to allergic asthma. The leucine rich repeat containing 32 gene (LRRC32) is a plausible causal candidate in this region, as it is expressed in activated Treg cells, of which numbers and immune suppressive function appear to be impaired in asthma.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 26932, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Our analyses also provided independent evidence for association with four of the eight loci previously reported to associate with asthma risk at the genome-wide significance level, specifically with the ORMDL3 locus, IL18R1, IL33, and IL2RB.

On the other hand, we found no supporting evidence for an association with PDE4D or DENND1B variants, despite appropriate power.

Consistent with this hypothesis, we observed that quantitative genetic scores that represented the combined effect of thousands of common SNPs - each individually influencing asthma risk only weakly (e.g., median OR = 1.05 for Group 3 in Figure 2) in the GABRIEL study - were significantly associated with asthma case-control status in our study. These results thus suggest that many of these SNPs are either in high LD with true causal variants that are common in the population but influence disease risk weakly, or they are in low LD with causal variants that are rarer but increase disease risk more strongly. The presence of both types of variants is not mutually exclusive; very large sample sizes will be needed to identify these through GWAS with genome-wide significance. The multi-SNP scores tested here, despite being significantly associated with asthma risk, provided low discrimination in disease status (i.e., low sensitivity and specificity) and so currently have little or no diagnostic utility per se, consistent with recent findings.

Similarly, asthma controls included both asthma-free and asthma-unknown individuals, with limited information on atopic status. As a result, our primary association analysis provided improved power to detect risk loci with homogeneous effects across different asthma subtypes but was likely underpowered to detect loci with subtype-specific effects.

At this stage, it is unclear which gene underlies the association with 11q13.5. Given that no specific gene in this region has been directly implicated in allergic disease previously, further characterisation of this region of association is likely to discover novel molecular mechanisms involved in the causality of eczema, atopy and asthma.

Most linkage and candidate-gene association studies were underpowered to detect genetic loci with effect sizes now considered realistic for common diseases and so often the identified regions or genes failed to replicate in independent studies. As a result, prior to 2007, over 100 loci had been implicated in asthma causation, but which, if any, represented genuine risk factors was largely unclear. Since 2007, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have contributed significantly to change this landscape. In the largest GWAS of asthma published to date, the GABRIEL consortium identified six loci associated with asthma risk at the genome-wide significance level: IL18R1, HLA-DQ, IL33, SMAD3, the ORMDL3 locus, and IL2RB. Given the size of that study, these represent the most convincing genetic risk factors for asthma reported until now. However, each explains only a small fraction of the disease heritability, indicating that many more risk loci remain to be identified. This can be achieved by expanding and combining existing asthma GWAS, as we have done in this study.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 42159, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "Interpretation", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 42174, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Our study identifies two additional loci with genome-wide significant association with asthma risk: IL6R and chromosome 11q13.5.
