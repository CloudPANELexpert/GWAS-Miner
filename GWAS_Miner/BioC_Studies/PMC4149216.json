A joint analysis of both males and females could not be performed as the difference in alcohol consumption variance was too large. Genome-wide association analyses were performed for approximately 300,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Significant associations found in the ALDH2 region for AD (minimum p = 4.73x10-8) and two AD-related phenotypes: flushing response (minimum p = 4.75x10-26) and maximum drinks in a 24-hour period (minimum p = 1.54x10-16). Association of previous candidate SNP, rs10774610 in CCDC63, was confirmed but resulted from linkage disequilibrium with ALDH2. ALDH2 is strongly associated with flushing response, AD, and maximum drinks in males, with nonsynonymous SNP rs671 explaining 29.2%, 7.9% and 22.9% of phenotypic variation, respectively, in this sample. When rs671 was considered as a candidate SNP in females, it explained 23.6% of the variation in flushing response, but alcohol consumption rates were too low among females - despite familial enrichment for AD - for an adequate test of association for either AD or maximum drinks.

Genes in the latter family, primarily ALDH2, are associated with the flushing reaction seen in some East Asian populations. These variants have substantial public health importance beyond their relationship to flushing and AD, as acetaldehyde exposure is also a key risk factor for gastrointestinal tract neoplasms and the flushing response itself is a indicator of esophageal cancer risk.

One contributing factor is the reliance on diagnosis - a dichotomous phenotype - rather than continuous phenotypes, which have greater statistical power and may be better correlated with the underlying genetic risk. Furthermore, GWAS have been conducted almost exclusively in samples of European ancestry, which risks missing variants at very low frequency in European populations. We address these two issues in the present study by considering additional phenotypes related to AD risk - flushing response and the maximum number of standardized drinks consumed in a 24-hour period - in a Chinese population underrepresented in GWAS. Flushing response (and the associated negative physical symptoms that occur in the presence of high acetaldehyde concentrations) is an intermediate phenotype that appears to mediate the volume of alcohol an individual can consume comfortably. Because this phenotype is most common in East Asian populations, occurring in nearly 40% of individuals in the present study but less than 10% of Europeans, its potential influence is enhanced by this sample selection, while unlikely to play a major role in populations of European or African biogeographic ancestry. \"Maximum drinks\" is a continuous measure that is highly correlated with AD.

This is particularly relevant for studies of AD, where consistency of exposure across the sample is an important factor. We addressed an important deviation from consistency of exposure between males and females by focusing the analysis on men. The primary limitation of this overall approach is that risk variants (and perhaps genes) underlying disease susceptibility in a specific population or family may not be the same as those contributing to vulnerability in other populations.
