Here our aims were, first, to explore to what extent genetic and environmental influences contributed to the individual differences in breastfeeding behaviour; second, to detect possible genetic variants related to breastfeeding; and lastly, to test if the genetic variants associated with breastfeeding have been previously found to be related with breast size. Data were collected from a large community-based cohort of Australian twins, with 3,364 women for the twin modelling analyses and 1,521 of them included in the genome wide association study. Monozygotic twin correlations (rMZ = .52, 95% CI .46 - .57) were larger than dizygotic twin correlations (rDZ = .35, 95% CI .25 - .43) and the best-fitting model was the one composed by additive genetics and unique environmental factors, explaining 53% and 47% of the variance in breastfeeding behaviour, respectively. No breastfeeding-related genetic variants reached genome-wide significance. The polygenic risk score analyses showed no significant results, suggesting breast size does not influence breastfeeding.

It has been suggested that breastfeeding duration in prehistoric times was of two to three years and that, from the Middle Ages to the 19th century, most infants in Europe were typically weaned between the ages of one and two. It was not until the end of the 19th century, that is, in our recent history, that artificial feeding became a safe alternative to breast milk, and breastfeeding became dependant on the mother's choice in most milieus. Consequently, nowadays a large variability in this behaviour can be observed both within and between countries, with global statistics showing that 37% of infants were exclusively breastfed until 6 months age in 2007, which is the current recommended minimum weaning age. This percentage varied considerably across countries, for example 18.8% in the U.S in 2011, 17.6% in Australia in 2011-2012 (Australian Bureau of Statistics, 2013) and 28.5% in Spain in 2011-2012.

Breastfeeding is a biocultural behaviour and is influenced by multiple factors, such as the action of prolactin and oxytocin, pain from nipple trauma, mastitis, maternal exhaustion and perceived poor milk supply , babies' sucking dynamics, body mass index, level of education, working conditions, psychological factors, personality, self-efficacy, anxiety (Brown, 2014), support from partner, family and peers, social norms, or advice of health professionals.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 3784, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The magnitude of the genetic and environmental sources of variance in breastfeeding behaviour were explored in a previous study in a cohort of Spanish twins from the Murcia Twin Registry.
