Migraine attacks are typically characterized by severe throbbing unilateral headache and nausea, vomiting and photo- and phonophobia (migraine without aura; MO). In up to one third of patients attacks may be associated with neurological aura symptoms (migraine with aura; MA). Previous genome-wide association studies (GWAS) identified a migraine susceptibility locus on chromosome 8q22, close to MTDH, in the clinic-based International Headache Genetics Consortium (IHGC) MA study and three other loci in or near PRDM16, LRP1, and TRPM8 in the population-based migraine Women's Genome Health Study (WGHS). For TRPM8 there was suggestive association (P < 1 x 10-5) also in the clinic-based IHGC MA GWAS. Here we report the first GWAS in MO, the most common form of migraine. We analyzed two large samples from headache centres in Germany and the Netherlands including 2,326 MO patients and 4,580 population-matched controls (Supplementary Note and Supplementary Fig. 1). A quantile-quantile plot of the joint analysis (Supplementary Fig. 2) and an overall inflation factor (lambda1000) of 1.03 were used as final quality control measures. The discovery dataset identified one genome-wide significant (P < 5 x 10-8) locus on chromosome 1q22 as well as eleven additional loci containing multiple SNPs with suggestive association (P < 1 x 10-5) (Supplementary Table 1). Eighteen SNPs from these 12 loci were taken forward to the replication stage in four independent clinic-based European MO samples (2,508 cases and 2,652 controls) (Supplementary Fig. 1 and Supplementary Table 1). Eight SNPs in six loci showed P-values < 0.05 in the replication study, and five of these SNPs also showed P-values < 5 x 10-8 in the meta-analysis combining the discovery and replication cohorts (Table 1, Fig. 1 and Supplementary Fig. 3).

In addition, we tested top SNPs of the four previously identified migraine loci (1p36, 2q37, 8q22, 12q13) in the replication stage (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Table 1), of which 2q37 and 12q13 convincingly replicated. Because migraine is more prevalent in women, we performed a gender interaction analysis for the reported SNPs (Supplementary Table 2). No significant interactions were observed and all SNPs had relatively similar odds ratios in both genders.

All associated SNPs are located within the MEF2D (myocyte enhancer factor 2D) gene (i.e. intronic and 3'-UTR) that encodes a transcription factor highly expressed in brain. MEF2D regulates neuronal differentiation by supporting survival of newly formed neurons. Perhaps even more relevant to migraine, neuronal activity-dependent activation of MEF2D restricts the number of excitatory synapses. As the migraine brain is hyperexcitable, it is tempting to speculate that MEF2D dysregulation may affect neuronal excitatory neurotransmission in MO patients. There is some evidence for increased glutamate (the main brain excitatory neurotransmitter) levels in migraine patients and increased glutamatergic neurotransmission was reported in a transgenic knock-in mouse model with a pathogenic human hemiplegic migraine gene mutation. A role for MEF2D dysregulation in migraine is also plausible given that several MEF2 target genes have been associated with other neurological disorders, such as epilepsy. Notably, pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide-38 (PACAP-38), which is encoded by one of the activity-regulated MEF2D target genes and modulates excitatory synaptic transmission, may trigger migraine-like attacks in patients with MO. In mice, PACAP-38 is involved in nitroglycerol-induced trigeminovascular activation, the presumed origin of the migraine headache.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 5769, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The 3p24 locus contained top SNP rs7640543 (initial P = 2.72 x 10-6, OR = 1.20).

PHACTR1 has further been implicated in endothelial cell functioning and susceptibility to early-onset myocardial infarction. Thus, the link between PHACTR1 and migraine could be neuronal through aberrant synaptic transmission or vascular since endothelial dysfunction, cardiovascular disease and myocardial infarction all seemed to be linked with migraine.

Rs6478241 is located in ASTN2, a member of the astrotactin gene family, which plays a role in glial-guided migration that seems important for development of the laminar architecture of cortical regions in the brain.
