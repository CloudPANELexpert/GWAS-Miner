Numerous studies have clearly established that intermediate markers of subclinical atherosclerosis may be useful in risk prediction of clinical vascular events. These markers reflecting biological and genetic different phenotypes of atherosclerosis include artery flow-mediated dilation, arterial stiffness, carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT), coronary calcification, carotid plaque, and stenosis. Recently, the Tromso Study, in a research conducted in 3,240 men and 3,344 women, demonstrated as total plaque area appears to be a stronger predictor than cIMT for IS. Moreover, compared to other methods such as measurement of cIMT, carotid plaque burden (CPB), as the sum of plaque area, has been indicated as the strongest cross-sectional predictor of coronary artery calcium score suggesting its clinical utility as predictor of future cardiovascular events.

Globally, the number of smokers even continues to increase and is estimated to be 1.7 billion by 2025. Experimental, epidemiological and clinical data strongly implicate that cigarette smoking is one of the major modifiable risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD) and IS, and impacts all phases of atherosclerosis.

Myc has been involved in both endothelial dysfunction and atherogenesis as well.

TLR4 is not only located intracellularly but also functions intracellularly and internalization of LPS is required for activation.

In the present study, which is aimed to investigate risk in carotid plaque, the lack in the replication data regarding genetic interactions with smoking previously found in cIMT study may further support the hypothesis suggesting as plaque and cIMT are two distinct phenotypes of atherosclerosis under different genetic and environmental control. Genome-wide gene-smoking interaction study allows us to catch up interesting genes associated with subclinical markers of atherosclerosis, although the gene-environment investigation further increases inter-subject variability to the disease. So far the studies that analyzed the interactions between cigarette smoking and gene variants in relation to risks for vascular disease did not reach consistent results. Cigarettes can modify genes quantitatively by changing expression levels and qualitatively by causing DNA mutations. Mainly, Wang XL et al. summarized these results as: \"although relationships between increased exposure to cigarette smoking or genetic risk and vascular disease can be expected to be linear, the relationships are significantly modified when cigarette and genes interact in real life\". In fact, various animal models have been exposed to cigarette smoking to observe smoking effects on atherogenesis and most of them have shown accelerated atherogenesis under smoke influence. However, none of the studied genes in these animals are specific and direct targets of cigarette smoking. A possible reason could be just the difficulty in reproducing the real-life human effect of cigarette smoking in which lungs process smoke toxins before they get to the target via the blood stream. Of particular interest may be to analyze the interaction between smoking effect and genetic variants associated with endothelial dysfunction as precursor of overt atherosclerosis that may allow anticipating the possible biases present when the disease already exist in the vessel, such as the carotid plaque. Moreover, further studies could be important to understand the impact of smoking/genetics interactions in different circulatory systems such as coronary microcirculation with a specific blood flow hemodynamic and diverse genetic variants associated with risk for atherosclerosis.
