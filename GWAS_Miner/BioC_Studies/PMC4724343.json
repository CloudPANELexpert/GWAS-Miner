We implicated rs9829896 as a cis-eQTL for the KAT2B gene and as a trans-eQTL for the CREBBP and OPRM1 genes, using mRNA expression levels measured in human prefrontal cortex. The proteins encoded by CREBBP and OPRM1 are members of the cAMP and dopamine pathways, respectively, and both pathways have been widely studied for their roles in drug addiction. Our regulatory evidence suggests that rs9829896 may be a biologically important SNP that may contribute to differential expression of cAMP and dopamine pathway genes in human prefrontal cortex among AAs: pathways by which the C allele may have its observed protective effect on risk of drug abuse also among AAs.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 25461, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The cAMP pathway is activated by drugs of abuse, and the protein encoded by KAT2B is a direct regulator of this pathway. KAT2B promotes transcription activation by inducing epigenetic changes (specifically, increased histone H3K9 acetylation) that enhance the occupancy of promoter binding sites by the CREB protein and its cofactor (CREB regulated transcription coactivator 2, CRTC2), leading to increased expression of target genes. The CREB protein is bound by another transcriptional regulator, known as CREBBP (or CBP). CREB and CREBBP were recently highlighted in a pathway analysis using GWAS results for opioid dependence. Our GeneMANIA network drew a biological connection between KAT2B and CREBBP based on their physical interaction, pathways, and shared protein domains, and we found that expression of both genes was down-regulated by the protective allele for drug abuse, rs9829896-C, specifically in AAs. The trans-eQTL pattern between the protective rs9829896-C allele and reduced CREBBP gene expression is consistent with prior indications related to drug-seeking behavior. Mice with CREBBP depleted in the nucleus accumbens show impaired sensitivity and reward from cocaine exposure, suggesting that behavioral response to cocaine is regulated, at least in part, by CREBBP. Assuming that the same pattern holds in humans, we expect that attenuation in drug rewarding effects due to reduced CREBBP expression would decrease susceptibility to abusing drugs.

Down-regulation of OPRM1 may play a role in increasing risk of heroin abuse, by depriving the opioid system of a key compensatory response to heroin exposure.
