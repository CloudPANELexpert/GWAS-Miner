Abnormalities in EDA have been linked to psychiatric conditions such as schizophrenia and psychopathy, leading to proposals that it be used as an endophenotype. Endophenotypes are laboratory-measured characteristics present in individuals who are predisposed to a psychiatric disorder:regardless of the presence of overt symptoms of that disorder. Considered more proximal to the effect of genes than the psychiatric phenotypes with which they are associated, they may provide an easier route to the genetic architecture underlying that disorder. Various criteria have been proposed to identify endophenotypes, including that they are stable over time, heritable, present in affected and unaffected relatives, and able to predict the subsequent development of psychopathology in longitudinal research.

EDA reflects arousal processes and indexes the degree of perceived stimulus significance, for example, when the stimulus has relevance to the subject, as in a conditioning study (e.g.,) or in a recognition memory protocol such as the concealed information or guilty knowledge test. EDA includes both tonic and phasic components. Tonic components include skin conductance level (SCL), a baseline measure that changes slowly with altered arousal state, and nonspecific fluctuations consisting of spontaneous responses that arise in the absence of apparent stimulation and that also index arousal. Phasic responses are stimulus elicited, and typically quantified by measuring the change in conductance (the skin conductance response, SCR) that occurs in response to a discrete stimulus. EDA is often measured in classic conditioning experiments, but as a putative endophenotype, it is probably most commonly assessed as part of a habituation task in which subjects listen to a series of intermittently presented tones that initially trigger orienting responses, followed eventually by ceased responding. EDA has also been hypothesized to index a defensive reaction in response to a stimulus that is potentially so aversive that it threatens well-being or survival. In this context, habituation of the response would not be expected, and a \"fight or flight\" response would ensue. In EDA protocols commonly used in psychopathology research, diminished responding, characterized by low SCL, small SCRs, and rapid habituation (or total lack of responding) has been associated with psychotic and externalizing psychopathology.

For example,, in a study that included reared apart twins, reported that 70% of the variance in the rate of electrodermal habituation was attributable to genetic factors.

As EDA is operationalized in multiple ways (e.g., response frequency, rate of habituation, etc.), one or more of them may be more closely linked to one of the three circuits above. For example, an electrodermal defensive response following a noxious stimulus probe would be linked more tightly to the second circuit in the hypothalamus and limbic system, while tonic SCL indexing arousal state would be mediated more by the reticular formation in the brain. However, it is worth noting that there is much overlap among these various operationalizations of EDA, reflecting perhaps a general lability-stability dimension in which EDA responses to various types of stimuli account for individual differences in any type of experiment.

At the other end of the spectrum exist atheoretical techniques such as genome-wide association studies (GWAS), which test whether common variations across the entire genome are related to a given phenotype. No study has examined whether EDA can serve as an endophenotype directly using GWAS. This is in part because, unlike diagnostic or questionnaire data, psychophysiological data are prohibitively expensive and time consuming to collect from the thousands of subjects who are likely needed for GWAS. In between these two extremes exist other techniques that test whether particular SNPs from genes implicated in certain functions (e.g., neurotransmitter systems) show significant association with EDA (versatile gene-based association study, VEGAS), or how much phenotypic variance is accounted for by the joint effects of all SNPs together (genome-wide complex trait analyses; GCTA). Note that this is critically different from a GWAS, which examines the degree to which each individual SNP accounts for variance in a trait.

The size of the current population-based twin family sample (N = 4,424) made practical the first-ever application of GWAS to electrodermal system function. The current study employed a habituation protocol that was modeled closely after procedures we have used successfully in past research with schizophrenia and mood disorder patients and their first-degree relatives. This protocol, which involved the presentation of loud tones while subjects were immersed in another task (in this case, watching a movie), identified anomalous responses in both the patients and their relatives, a pattern of results that is consistent with EDA as an endophenotype for psychotic disorders. Again using this same habituation paradigm, we have also shown EDA to be stable over a one-year interval, and heritable in twins reared apart. Importantly, using a subset of twins also included in this investigation, we showed that the association between externalizing psychopathology and EDA was mediated by shared genetic influence, also an important criterion for an endophenotype.

The weighted and unweighted GCTA analyses based on unrelated individuals were also revealing. Considering the EDA factor score, which provides an excellent summary index for EDA, and using different cutoffs to select unrelated individuals, we found that the SNP heritability approximated .35, well below all the phenotypic heritability estimates, which exceeded .50. Despite the imprecision inherent in the GCTA estimates from unrelated people, they point to the conclusion that much of the additive genetic influence in EDA is due to common genetic variants, suggesting that it was the combined effect of multiple SNPs that accounted for a substantial amount of variation in EDA. Such findings provide compelling evidence that variations in electrodermal activity are likely to result from small additive effects of many genes acting in concert, rather than any single mutation. Hence, using a proven endophenotype-relevant EDA protocol shown to be associated with several different types of psychiatric disorder, we found ample evidence to support the heritability of EDA as well as evidence that the genetic influence on EDA is due at least in part to common SNPs that we measured.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 37509, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Against this backdrop, we surveyed the effects associated with all the SNPs on the Illumina array and all the genes available to us through VEGAS.

Hence, our results for EDA depended on our driving our measures from this procedure.

These results may seem somewhat contradictory to the notion of an endophenotype, which are considered to be simpler units of analyses than overt psychiatric symptoms, and thus presumably linked more directly to the genetic origins of psychiatric disorders. However, it is worth noting that others have pointed out that endophenotypes, despite their direct ties to neurobiology, may themselves be polygenic in origin.
