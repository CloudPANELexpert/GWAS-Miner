Alternatively, we could have derived a \"positive response\" phenotype more similar to that of the University College London cohort or other lithium-response cohorts. We elected not to categorize time to recurrence outcomes for the STEP-BD cohort in terms of \"good\" or \"poor\" response because to do so would have entailed an arbitrary distinction. Still, the lack of correspondence between the responsiveness phenotype in the two cohorts suggests that failure to \"replicate\" should be interpreted cautiously.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 25187, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Taken together, our results do suggest a number of regions meriting further investigation.
