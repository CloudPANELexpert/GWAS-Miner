In subjects who were homozygous for the wild-type allele, FEV1 improved by a factor of three after therapy with inhaled glucocorticoids, as compared with those who were homozygous for the mutant allele (pooled P = 0.0007). Moreover, subjects who were homozygous for the mutant allele were about two and a half times as likely to have a poor response to inhaled glucocorticoids (lowest quartile) as were those who were homozygous for the wild-type allele. Overall, this variant accounted for 6.6% of the variability related to the lowest-quartile response, indicating that variation at this locus may account for a substantial proportion of patients who have a poor response to therapy with inhaled glucocorticoids.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 22516, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "In this study, we identified a consistent genetic association that was replicated in three of four independent clinical trials with a combined total of 935 subjects.

Its role in glucocorticoid signaling was first described by Chapman et al., who identified several differentially expressed sequenced tags in glucocorticoid-sensitive and glucocorticoid-resistant thymoma-derived cell lines after the administration of dexamethasone. One of these, GIG18 (glucocorticoid-induced gene 18), showed marked up-regulation. Now called GLCCI1, it is expressed in both lung cells and immune cells, and its expression is significantly enhanced by the presence of glucocorticoids in asthmalike conditions (Fig. 2 in the Supplementary Appendix). GLCCI1 may be an early marker of glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis. Apoptosis is a key mechanism through which glucocorticoids resolve lymphocytic and eosinophilic inflammation in asthma. Therefore, decreased GLCCI1 expression, as a result of rs37973, may reduce inflammatory-cell apoptosis, leading to a diminished clinical response to inhaled glucocorticoids.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 24040, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Our study has several limitations. First, we specifically focused on 100 top-powered SNPs; the vast majority of SNPs in the genomewide association study were not tested. Clearly, a more comprehensive interrogation is warranted. Second, at enrollment, 85% of SOCS and SLIC participants reported recent use of inhaled glucocorticoids. Nonetheless, we noted a robust response to inhaled glucocorticoids during the common run-in period. Third, although our results would suggest that rs37973 has a functional role, other potential functional variants (e.g., alternative splice or intronic variants) may be present within GLCCI1. Although further mechanistic studies are needed to clarify the precise role of GLCCI1 in the response to asthma treatment, our elucidation of a functional variant to support the association finding far exceeds that of the typical genomewide study.

(FBAT) screening algorithm was applied to genomewide genotyping data in parent-child trios corresponding to probands randomly assigned to treatment with inhaled glucocorticoids (ICS) in the Childhood Asthma Management Program (CAMP), in order to identify the top 100 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in terms of power for replication (heritability) in association with changes in forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1). These SNPs were tested for association in the CAMP population, and 13 variants were genotyped in three independent replication populations (in the Salmeterol or Corticosteroids [SOCS] and Salmeterol +- Inhaled Corticosteroids [SLIC] trials, the Adult Study, and the Leukotriene Modifier or Corticosteroid or Corticosteroid-Salmeterol [LOCCS] trial). One variant, rs37972, was associated in each population. The potential for function of this variant and a closely correlated variant, rs37973, was assessed, and rs37973 was confirmed to alter expression of the glucocorticoid-induced transcript 1 gene (GLCCI1); rs37973 was then tested for overall association with the response to ICS therapy in four independent clinical-trial populations.

For each population, the additive model showed a significant association, with poorer responses being associated with the mutant (T) allele (Liptak combined P = 0.0007). The rs37972 minor-allele frequencies for the SS, Adult Study, LOCCS, and CARE populations were 0.40, 0.38, 0.38, and 0.37, respectively. Since rs37972 correlates perfectly (is in complete linkage disequilibrium) with rs37973, the within-trial clinical response was identical for the latter variant (data not shown).

The position of the first methionine (Met), the start codon of GLCCI1, is shown. Indicated DNA fragments were cloned into luciferase vectors for the enhancer assay. Panel B shows the allelic differences in relative luciferase activity in Jurkat cells, Raji cells, and human acute monocytic leukemia (THP-1) cells, obtained with the use of a pGL4.23-luciferase vector. Data represent mean (+- SD) values from one experiment performed in triplicate and are expressed relative to the luciferase activity of the mock transfectant, which was arbitrarily set at 1. P values were calculated with the use of Student's t-test. Similar results were obtained in three independent experiments. Panel C shows results of an electrophoretic mobility-shift assay (EMSA) of rs37973 in Jurkat, Raji, and THP-1 cells. The intensity of each band on EMSA was analyzed by densitometry, and the intensity ratio of each G-allele band to each A-allele band is shown. Two independent experiments were performed with similar results. The genomic region containing the A allele of rs37973 was predicted to bind two transcription factors, CCAAT/enhancer binding protein (C/EBP) alpha and zinc finger E-box binding homeobox 1 (ZEB1). Although the signal intensity of the DNA-protein complex derived from the A allele was higher than that from the G allele in the presence of nuclear extract of each of the cell lines on EMSA, we could not confirm the binding of C/EBP alpha and ZEB1 to the sequence by supershift assay (data not shown).
