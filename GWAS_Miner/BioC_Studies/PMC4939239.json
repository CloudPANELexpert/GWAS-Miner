There is a substantial disparity in African-American men, who have higher age-adjusted incidence rates (99.9 per 100,000) when compared with Caucasian and Asian men (76.4 and 52.2 per 100,000, respectively), as well as higher age-adjusted death rates (African American 82.6 per 100,000; Caucasian 65.3 per 100,000; Asian 35.9 per 100,000). Smoking represents the major risk factor for lung cancer. Known differences in smoking-related exposures for African Americans could contribute to the observed differences in incidence, including age of smoking initiation, intensity of smoking, and quitting and relapse behaviors. It has been estimated that approximately eighty-five percent of lung cancer risk is attributed to cigarette smoking; however, the higher incidence seen in African Americans occurs even though they smoke fewer cigarettes per day than their Caucasian counterparts. Family and twin studies, as well as lung cancer genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have confirmed an underlying genetic contribution to lung cancer risk as well. To date, GWAS performed in populations of European and Asian descent have identified over 15 lung cancer risk loci (Supplementary Table 1). Interestingly, other than the hTERT region on chromosome 5p15, the regions identified in non-smoking Asian women do not overlap with the regions identified in Europeans who smoke, suggesting distinct genetic contributions to primary lung carcinogenesis and smoking-related carcinogenesis. Although African Americans have higher lung cancer incidence and poorer lung cancer survival when compared with other racial and ethnic populations in the United States, no GWAS has been conducted in this population. In addition, African admixture in African Americans could provide an opportunity to identify new lung cancer risk alleles. Smoking behavior also has a significant genetic component, as reported in family, twin and GWAS studies. Given differences in smoking exposures and genetic architecture in African Americans as compared to Europeans and Asians, studies of genetic variation contributing to risk of lung cancer in African Americans might help explain the racial difference observed in lung cancer incidence and survival, and identify novel markers of lung cancer susceptibility.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 4400, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Studies have been conducted to further interrogate chromosomal regions 2q31.1, 5p15.33, 6p22.1-p21.31, and 15q25.1 in African Americans, including fine mapping studies.

The first SNP marker, rs2036527 on 15q25.1 is located 511 base pairs from the initiation sequence for CHRNA5, in the gene cluster CHRNA5-CHRNA3-CHRNA4 that codes for the alpha5, alpha3, beta5 subunits of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR). Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors initiate the primary brain and peripheral responses to smoking. A number of studies have implicated the nAChR gene cluster in smoking-related phenotypes, including cigarettes smoked per day, smoking 100 cigarettes or more in a lifetime, persistent smoking, heavy smoking, quitting attempts, age at smoking initiation, pleasurable early smoking experience, reported physical effects after smoking first cigarette and serum cotinine levels. These observations have been reported primarily in populations of European ancestry. Some of the above-mentioned studies include African Americans; yet, small sample size was an issue for some. However, rs2036527 was observed to be associated with smoking quantity in African Americans through a GWAS meta-analysis of 32,389 subjects from the Study of Tobacco in Minority Populations Genetics Consortium. This SNP has also been associated with nicotine dependence in the Finnish Twin Cohort Study and cigarettes smoked per day. However, we did not see a similar association in our data when examining current versus former smokers (p=0.29), and only nominally significant (p=0.038) if modeling cigarettes smoked per day, perhaps due to the small sample size and that African Americans on average smoke cigarettes differently than Caucasians. It has been shown that CPD is less predictive of smoke intake in African-American smokers when compared with Caucasian smokers. When examining carbon monoxide (CO), a biomarker of cigarette smoke, Bloom et al. observed that the correlation between CO and CPD is significantly lower in African Americans when compared with European Americans. Additionally, we recognize that comparing current versus former smokers or examining CPD is not an ideal surrogate for nicotine dependency; however, in the assembled dataset, these are the best measures available.

It has been shown that rs2036527 is associated with tumor DNA methylation levels in the promoter of CHRNB4, suggesting that genotype-specific methylation may be associated with susceptibility to lung cancer. Because this SNP has been associated with smoking habits, it is not clear whether smoking may also play a role in the epigenetic deregulation. Further investigations into the functional implications of this relationship are warranted.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 21778, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The second genome-wide significant SNP observed in our study, rs2853677, is located in the first intron of TERT on chromosome 5p15.33. In a case-control study of Caucasian and African-American women, rs2853677 was associated with non-small cell lung cancer in both populations when the data were stratified by race. Furthermore, rs2853677 has been shown to be associated with lung cancer susceptibility in a Japanese GWAS. In a recent report, the A allele of rs2853677 displayed pleiotropy between different cancer types. The same allele is positively associated with testicular germ cell tumor and pancreatic cancer, but negatively associated with glioma and lung cancers, which includes some of the African-American individuals in this study. Additionally, concordant with earlier work, we observed that rs2853677 had a histology-specific association with risk of adenocarcinoma. Variants on 5p15.33 detected upstream of, and within, intron 1 of TERT (rs2735940 and rs2736100) have been observed to be associated with risk of adenocarcinoma. rs2853677 is in moderate linkage disequilibrium (LD) with rs2735940 and rs2736100 in 1000 Genome Project CEU data (r2 = 0.42 and 0.56, respectively) as compared with moderate to low LD (r2 = 0.34 and 0.04, respectively) in 1000 Genomes Project YRI data. This suggests that using an African-American population can refine the association signals in this complex region. We have further confirmed its association with lung cancer in African Americans at a genome-wide significance level by replicating the finding in additional samples of African Americans. Further functional interrogation is warranted.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 23425, "infons": {"section_type": "CONCL", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "5.
