Bone mineral density (BMD) is highly heritable, is a major predictor of osteoporotic fractures and has been previously associated with common genetic variants, and rare, population-specific, coding variants. Here we identify novel non-coding genetic variants with large effects on BMD (ntotal = 53,236) and fracture (ntotal = 508,253) in individuals of European ancestry from the general population. Associations for BMD were derived from whole-genome sequencing (n=2,882 from UK10K), whole-exome sequencing (n= 3,549), deep imputation of genotyped samples using a combined UK10K/1000Genomes reference panel (n=26,534), and de-novo replication genotyping (n= 20,271). We identified a low-frequency non-coding variant near a novel locus, EN1, with an effect size 4-fold larger than the mean of previously reported common variants for lumbar spine BMD (rs11692564[T], MAF = 1.7%, replication effect size = +0.20 standard deviations [SD], Pmeta = 2x10-14), which was also associated with a decreased risk of fracture (OR = 0.85; P = 2x10-11; ncases = 98,742 and ncontrols = 409,511). Using an En1Cre/flox mouse model, we observed that conditional loss of En1 results in low bone mass, likely as a consequence of high bone turn-over.

In general, there was an excess of association signals arising from deleterious coding and conserved non-coding variants.

Studies of calvarial bone development and fracture healing of long bones in mice have shown that perinatal En1-/- mutants display osteopenia and enhanced skull bone resorption, whereas in normal adult mice En1 is up-regulated in the bone callus post fracture. Investigating the functional role of EN1, we detected En1 expression during osteoblastogenesis in developing and mature cultured murine calvarial osteoblasts, but not in marrow-derived osteoclasts, or in human primary osteoclast cultures (Figure 3a and Extended Data Fig. 3). To determine where En1 is active in adult bones, we analyzed vertebrae from En1lacZ/+ knock-in mice and detected LacZ expression in proliferative and hypertrophic chondrocytes, osteogenic cells in the periosteum and trabecular bone surface, and in osteocytes of cortical and trabecular bone (Fig. 3b and Extended Data Fig. 4).", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 11119, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Using En1Cre/+; R26lox-STOP-lox--EYFP reporter mice to genetically tag cells for which the En1 promoter was active at any point within a cell lineage, we confirmed that En1 expression was only observed in osteogenic lineages (Extended Data Fig. 4).

The driving force for the low bone mass would appear to be an increase in osteoclastic activity induced by En1 null osteogenic cells. This in turn initiates the expected coupled increase in mineralizing bone formation (Fig. 3b & 3d) mediated by an increased number of osteogenic cells and thus conforms to a high turnover osteoporosis-like phenotype, although dynamic histomorphometry and evidence from bone turn-over markers would be required to confirm an increased rate of bone formation (Extended Data Fig. 4). Lastly, genetic evidence from homologous regions in mice also supported a role for En1 in bone, as the homologous region contained a QTL peak for femur BMD (Supplementary Table 11).

These variants have effect sizes up to four-fold larger than the mean effect described for common variants associated with BMD and approximately three-fold larger than those for fracture. Our study illustrates that larger reference panels, covering relevant ethnicities, will facilitate the discovery of low frequency and rare variants. This was enabled here by a large imputation reference panel (UK10K and 1000 Genomes) which offers 10-fold more European samples than the 1000 Genomes reference panel alone. Although we did not identify coding low-frequency or rare variants associated with BMD at a genome-wide significant level, we did observe that deleterious coding variants were enriched for association as a group. This suggests the existence of as yet undiscovered coding variants influencing BMD. Importantly, we have also generated new functional evidence for a central role of the engrailed homeobox-1 gene in regulation of BMD and outlined En1 as a critical protein in bone biology. In summary, our findings demonstrate the utility of whole-genome sequencing-based discovery and deep imputation to enable the identification of novel genetic associations.
