Clinically, approximately 5-15% of patients with ALS have FTD, while about 3-14% of FTD patients also fulfill the criteria for ALS. Neuropathologically, the majority of FTD cases can be divided in two subtypes, characterized by cellular inclusions of either tau (FTD-tau) or TDP-43 (FTD-TDP).

By combining results from ALS and FTD datasets in a joint meta-analysis, we found a strong increase of association signals at both loci. Furthermore, by replication of top-associated SNPs from one disease in the other and vice versa, we found both the C9orf72 and UNC13A loci to be significantly associated in the ALS as well as in the FTD analysis.

Previously we have shown that rs12608932 acts as a modifier of survival in ALS, which was recently replicated in an Italian cohort of ALS patients. UNC13A, therefore, poses an interesting therapeutic target. The protein encoded by UNC13A is a member of a family of presynaptic proteins present throughout the nervous system and involved in the priming of presynaptic vesicles containing neurotransmitters before their release. Aberrant function of UNC13A disrupts the exocytosis of excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters. This not only affects the biochemical communication between neurons, but also triggers structural changes in existing neuronal networks. Furthermore, changes in the release of neurotransmitters as a consequence of defects in UNC13A are in line with the glutamate excitotoxicity hypothesis, previously implicated in motor neuron degeneration. Thus, our findings implicate changes in neurotransmitter release and synaptic function as a converging mechanism in the pathogenesis of ALS and FTD.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 27211, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The highly significant signal generated by 19 SNPs at the chromosome 9p21.2 locus is most likely linked to C9orf72 repeat expansion status.

First, mutations in KIAA0196 cause hereditary spastic paraplegia, which shares clinical upper motor neuron dysfunction with ALS. Second, KIAA0196 (alias SPG8) encodes for strumpellin, a valosin-containing protein (VCP) binding partner in the human central nervous system.

Third, protein aggregates containing strumpellin have been found in patients with inclusion body myopathy associated with Paget disease of bone and frontotemporal dementia (IBMPFD).
