Previously reported GWA studies have identified genetic variation accounting for a small portion of the overall genetic susceptibility to CD and an even smaller contribution to UC pathogenesis.

Such a tactic is attractive for IBD studies for several reasons. First, CD-affected children are more likely to have colonic CD than adults.

Here we report the results of an ongoing IBD GWA study in which we are testing an alternative hypothesis of stratifying cases by age of onset. We genotyped approximately 550,000 SNPs on the Illumina Human Hap550 Genotyping BeadChip in a discovery cohort of 1,011 IBD cases (including 647 CD and 317 UC, with the remainder being indeterminate colitis) of European ancestry and 4,250 ancestry-matched controls.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 5972, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "In the IBD discovery cohort, we compared single-marker allele frequencies using chi2 statistics for all markers.

The two noncoding variants on 20q13 are in strong linkage disequilibrium (LD) (rs2315008[T] and rs4809330[A]) and yield P values of 6.30 x 10-8 (corrected P = 0.032) and 6.95 x 10-8 (corrected P = 0.036), respectively, with protective odds ratios (OR) of 0.74 for both (Table 1).

As all previously discovered genes associated with IBD are primarily associated with CD, except for the notable exception of IRF5 in UC, it is important to note that the contribution to these newly identified signals comes from both UC and CD (Table 2). In addition, these signals replicate in an independent cohort of 173 IBD cases and 3,481 controls collected according to the same definitions as the discovery cohort after recruitment and genotyping of the discovery cohort was completed, as well as in the IBD cohort from the WTCCC study, which includes individuals with CD (Table 3).

Although we were unable to pinpoint the exact gene associated with the disease in this region based on LD or the fact that all the SNPs occurred in noncoding regions, we considered the TNFRSF6B gene the most compelling candidate on the basis of what is already known about the critical role of specific polymorphisms within genes involved in the TNF pathway in the pathogenesis of IBD. Moreover, our observation that the mRNA expression of TNFRSF6B is markedly different in colonic biopsies obtained from individuals with IBD compared to disease-free controls lends further support to the potential role of TNFRSF6B and the TNF-pathway in IBD (Fig. 2a). Furthermore, we found that TNFRSF6B mRNA expression correlated with the degree of mucosal inflammation within the colon (n = 31, r2 = 0.29, P = 0.002 for linear regression for the Crohn's disease histological index of severity (CDHIS) and TNFRSF6B expression). Although we did not observe any difference in colonic mRNA expression of TNFRSF6B between IBD subjects with and without the key alleles of these two identified SNPs, this may have been confounded by a greater degree of mucosal inflammation, and therefore different cell populations, in the colon biopsies for the subjects who did not carry the associated alleles (mean +- s.e.m.)
