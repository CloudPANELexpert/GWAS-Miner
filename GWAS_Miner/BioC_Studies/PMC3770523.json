Abrogating mutations in HNF1B result in diabetes phenotypes, including maturity-onset diabetes of the young subtype 5 (MODY5), as well as renal cysts. Of relevance to endometrial cancer, microdeletions encompassing HNF1B have been reported in Mayer-Rokitansky-Kuster-Hauser syndrome characterized by congenital aplasia of the uterus and upper vagina due to anomalous development of the Mullerian ducts, and HNF1B mutations/deletions are associated with uterine abnormalities due to incomplete Mullerian duct fusion and Mullerian duct aplasia. Human embryonic gene expression studies have shown that HNF1B expression occurs during early development of the human urogenital tract, with expression maintained in Wolffian duct derivatives but not in Mullerian duct deriviatives. In contrast, HNF1B over-expression has been reported to be a biomarker of clear cell carcinoma of the pancreas, and of clear cell carcinoma of the ovary and its probable precursor ovarian endometriosis. There is also evidence to suggest that HNF1B isoform usage may be altered in prostate cancer tissue, with upregulated HNF1B isoform B expression in prostate cancer tissue compared to benign tissue. Analysis of several lymphocyte-derived gene expression datasets (See Supplementary Fig. 2) reveals significant associations between rs4430796 genotype and HNF1B expression in individuals of European ancestry, but not for individuals of African ancestry.
