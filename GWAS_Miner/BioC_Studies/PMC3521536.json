Many candidate gene studies, including some in non-Caucasian populations, have examined the association of rs7412 (alone, or in concert with rs429358) with LDL and have detected strong associations.

We initially hypothesized that using LDL-C from EMR might prove difficult because some individuals may not have followed instructions to fast before blood draws. However, we believe the use of the median LDL-C measure helped to protect against the selection of incorrect measurements due to non-fasting status. If some non-fasting calculated LDL-C measurements did enter the dataset, we would anticipate that this would not occur differentially by genotype, and thus any error introduced should have biased the estimate of effect to the null. The detection of the rs7412 signal in a relatively small population and the relatively large percentage variance explained by the SNP suggest that the extraction of the phenotype from EMR may actually be advantageous in some ways compared to previous studies undertaken in traditional epidemiologic studies. We believe this is due to our ability both to use a median measure and to eliminate phenotypic noise due to multiple types of medication usage and concomitant illness reduced trait variance. Previously, it has been demonstrated that GWAS using average measures have increased power , and that an HDL-C GWAS right-censored based on relevant co-morbidity and medication history detected novel loci .
