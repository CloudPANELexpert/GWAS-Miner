In China, Tian et al (2006) found a spring peak (March) in schizophrenia admissions, although they noted that they did not distinguish between first episodes and readmission, which, according to Clarke et al (1999), may be necessary to isolate seasonality effects. However, there are studies that found no seasonal variation in schizophrenia, or that founds patterns contrary to those previously reported. For example, Aviv et al (2011), as well as Amr and Volpe (2012) did not find any seasonal effect on admission rates. In the Southern Hemisphere, Davies et al. (2000) found a peak in first episode schizophrenia admission in the winter (August), similar to Owens and McGorry (2003). In contrast, Daniels et al (2000) did not find a seasonal association in Tasmania with admission with diagnoses of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 23627, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "There is a certain clinical symptoms that overlap between SAD and SCZ, including cognitive deficits, social withdrawal, and changes in sleeping pattern. Furthermore, the incidence of SCZ has been found to be higher at higher latitudes, a pattern that's shared with SAD, and it has been shown that there is a season of birth effect for SCZ, and likewise for SAD which has led to the hypothesis that vitamin D plays a crucial role in the etiology of SCZ. Vitamin D improves mood in healthy individuals during winter and reduces depression scores in patients with SAD. The results of this study suggest that in addition to environmental modifiable risk factors such as UVB radiation, photoperiod, visible light intensity, vitamin D supplementation and levels, skin exposure (e.g. sunscreen, reduced outdoor activities), weight increase (resulting in lowering of vitamin D levels), SAD and SCZ share previously unacknowledged genetic risk factors that deserve studies in their own right. However, our study only provides evidence for an overlap in genetic risk factors between SCZ and seasonality. Further evidence for an association between seasonality is needed at both the genetic, environmental and clinical levels before seasonality can be considered as a component of SCZ.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 24904, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "In conclusion, we provide direct evidence for an expected genetic overlap in risk between bipolar disorder (but not major depressive disorder) and seasonality, and an somewhat less expected overlap between schizophrenia and seasonality.
