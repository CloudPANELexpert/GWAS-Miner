Posttraumatic stress disorder is often a lasting consequence of a traumatic experience that causes intense fear, hopelessness, and horror. Distinguished from the acute response to trauma, the stress reactions of PTSD patients do not resolve quickly. Instead, symptoms can last for long periods of time, over which they may increase in severity. The rate of PTSD is especially high among veterans. One study analyzing retrospective data observed that among American World War II prisoners of war, the rate of PTSD was about 50% 1 year after repatriation and 29% 40 years after repatriation.

Risk of PTSD is influenced by characteristics of the trauma and of the individual. For example, experiencing a direct threat of death, being female, having a pre-existing psychiatric disorder, and having experienced childhood maltreatment have been identified as predisposing to PTSD. In addition, genetic factors play important roles in PTSD risk. Twin studies have consistently shown that genetic components account for at least one third of the variance in risk of PTSD. Candidate gene association studies have implicated genes in the dopaminergic system, the serotonergic system, the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, and other neurotransmitter systems to be directly associated with PTSD or to interact with childhood maltreatment to regulate PTSD risk. Despite this, candidate gene association studies have failed to identify conclusively a genetic variant that exerts a main effect on risk of PTSD. A variant mapped to the serotonin transporter protein gene, SLC6A4, has, however, been shown in several studies to affect risk for PTSD and related symptoms in interaction with the environment. The candidate gene approach is usually limited to variants mapped to genes for which there are prior hypotheses about their roles in the etiology of PTSD.

This protein is expressed at high levels in the granular layer of the cerebellum of adult mice and in the hippocampus of both juvenile and adult mice. The hippocampus is a direct target of stress hormones. Cerebellum plays important roles in emotion processing and fear conditioning through connecting with the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. Studies have found that the development of cerebellum is more dependent on environmental factors than most other brain regions. It has been consistently shown that children and adolescents with a history of maltreatment have decreased cerebellar volume. Although TLL1 has not been previously associated with PTSD, functional studies suggest that glucocorticoids, which regulate stress response in mammals, could decrease mTll1 expression in vitro. An elevated number of hippocampal neurons expressing mTll1 were found in mice with increased neurogenesis, which is related to the stress response. Research on reptilian orthology of TLL1 isolated from turtle showed that the gene cleaves the precursor pro-brain-derived neurotrophic factor (proBDNF) into mature BDNF. The mature form of BDNF is involved in learning and memory and is very important in normal neural development.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 24436, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Previous studies have indicated that genetic factors influence the risk of exposure to trauma, perhaps through personality differences. Although exposure to trauma (or perceived exposure to trauma) is essential to PTSD, in the primary GWAS analyses, we did not restrict the control subjects to trauma-exposed subjects. The significant genetic markers found by this method thus contribute to the risk of PTSD after trauma exposure and/or trauma exposure, which lead to PTSD. After restricting the control subjects to those who were trauma exposed, the significant genetic markers would appear to contribute to PTSD risk only. Although the p values were less significant, which was probably due to a smaller sample size, the two most significant genomic regions did not change when this restriction was imposed on the control group. Thus, the two regions identified are most likely to contribute to PTSD, rather than trauma exposure.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 25368, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Our GWAS analyses of PTSD in AAs did not provide any strong evidence of association.

Recently, Logue et al. performed a PTSD GWAS study and observed that the RORA gene was a significant risk locus for PTSD. However, our study failed to replicate the results (Table S3 in Supplement 1). In the current GWAS, only one genomic region (TLL1) was successfully replicated and reached genome-wide significance.

There is high comorbidity between PTSD and substance dependence, and although we have replicated findings from other groups relevant to PTSD in this sample, it is possible that the findings are not applicable to PTSD in other patient populations. In addition, the size of the GWAS and replication samples was small, and thus the statistical power was low. Finally, our replicated results are specific to EA populations.
