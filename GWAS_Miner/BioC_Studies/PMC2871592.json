Known risk factors include a family history of the disease, previous germ cell tumor, subfertility, undescended testis (UDT) and testicular microlithiasis, the presence of small foci of intratesticular calcification. There are two main subclasses of TGCT: seminomas show histological features of primordial germ cells, whereas nonseminomas show varying degrees of differentiation toward embryonal and extraembryonal structures. Some tumors show features of both classes. TGCTs are believed to arise from progenitor germ cells through a preinvasive phase of intratubular germ cell neoplasia (ITGCN). The peak incidence of nonseminomas is between the ages of 20 and 30 years, whereas seminomas manifest about a decade later.

SNPs located in adjacent LD blocks showed much weaker evidence of association, suggesting that the causative variant resides within this block. In a multiple regression analysis, there was evidence that both rs995030 and rs1508595 are independently associated with disease risk (P = 0.03 in stage 2, P = 0.0006 overall, compared with a model with only a single risk marker). This suggests that, if there is a single causal variant, it is distinct from either marker. Within this LD block there is only one annotated protein-coding gene, KITLG (also known as stem cell factor or steel), which encodes the ligand for the membrane-bound receptor tyrosine kinase KIT. rs995030 is within the 3' untranslated region of KITLG and rs1508595 is in intergenic DNA 5' to KITLG. The possibility that KITLG is the gene through which the association is effected is supported by several previously reported observations. First, the KIT-KITLG system regulates the survival, proliferation and migration of germ cells, and germline homozygous null mutations of either gene in mice cause infertility as a result of failure of progenitor germ cell development. Second, germline heterozygous deletions that remove the complete KITLG coding sequence confer a twofold increased risk of TGCT in a spontaneous mouse model of the disease. Third, somatic missense mutations or amplification of KIT are present in ~25% of human seminomas, although they are very rare in nonseminomas (COSMIC; see URLs section in Online Methods). Paradoxically, the somatic changes of KIT found in seminomas activate its kinase, whereas the germline deletions of KITLG that modify susceptibility in mice are predicted to reduce it. Somatic mutations of KIT had previously been found in 14 seminomas included in the current study. The frequencies of the rs995030 and rs1508595 genotypes in these cases were not, however, different than those seen in the TGCT series as a whole.

Somatic rearrangements of the immunoglobulin heavy chain locus and BCL2 that result in constitutive BCL2 overexpression are found in B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia and follicular lymphomas. Expression of BAK1 in testicular germ cells is repressed by the KITLG-KIT pathway and interaction of BAK1 with antiapoptotic proteins is implicated in the germ cell apoptosis that occurs in response to blockade of this pathway. It is, therefore, plausible that rs210138 exerts its effects on TGCT susceptibility through BAK1, and may influence similar biological pathways as rs995030 and rs1508595, the SNPs in the vicinity of KITLG.

In lymphoblastoid cell lines the G allele of rs210138, which is associated with the elevated risk of testis cancer, is associated with lower expression of BAK1 (P = 0.00078) in the extended CEU population (GENEVAR project, see URLs section in Online Methods) (Fig. 1). The association was significant at the 0.05 permutation threshold, with other associated SNPs in the same LD block significant at the 0.01 level. This result suggests a biologically plausible mechanism by which reduction of BAK1 expression alleviates repression of antiapoptotic proteins, inhibiting apoptosis and hence contributing to neoplastic change.

For bilaterality and maldescent, the power to detect a difference was limited because of the small numbers examined. However, the absence of a difference between cases of seminoma compared to nonseminoma suggests that, despite their distinct histological and biological features, these two subclasses of TGCT share a common biological pathway of oncogenesis. Compatible with this notion are the existence of TGCT cases that have mixed pathology, the lack of evidence that, in cases with bilateral TGCT, the two tumors are more likely than by chance to share histological type and the lack of evidence for clustering of histological type in individual families with multiple TGCT cases.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 10297, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The failure to demonstrate a higher OR in familial TGCT cases compared to those without a family history is, however, surprising.

Although variants conferring similar relative risks have been found for other cancers (for example, in CHEK2), they are much rarer and population specific, indicative of strong negative selection. The absence of similar selection here is somewhat surprising given that the disease had a high fatality rate before the introduction of modern therapies, although negative selection may have been weaker in the past as the disease was rarer.
