Parameters were estimated using logistic regression models adjusted for age and sex. Analyses were not adjusted for principal components of population ancestry, as observed genomic inflation factors in unadjusted models (lambda = 1.031, lambda1,000 = 1.026 for ischemic stroke; lambda = 1.007, lambda1,000 = 1.011 for LAA) indicated an absence of bias due to population stratification. Meta-analysis genomic control inflation factors (lambda) were calculated as previously described, as were standardized values for a sample of 1,000 cases and 1,000 controls (lambda1,000). Secondary analyses of peak regions were adjusted for ancestry principal components and clinical traits, including hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes mellitus, atrial fibrillation, myocardial infarction and smoking status, to investigate potential confounders of the observed genetic associations. Association tests were performed using maximum-likelihood estimated dosages for imputed SNPs and observed integer dosages for genotyped SNPs. Logistic models were fitted using mach2dat software, which calculates significance levels for estimated parameters using a likelihood-ratio test. The two secondary logistic analyses conditioned on rs4479522 and rs556621 genotypes were adjusted for age, sex and integer-valued dosage of the test allele at conditioned SNPs.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 22646, "infons": {"section_type": "METHODS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Pairwise LD between SNPs was assessed and visualized using Haploview software on the basis of European (CEU) HapMap Phase 2 data.
