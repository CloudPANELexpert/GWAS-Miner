The 10q25 association showed consistent direction of effect in 9 out of the 10 studies, but achieved genome-wide significance only in the combined analyses of discovery and follow-up samples. Further replication of this locus in independent samples is warranted. Despite this limitation, this locus is of great interest due to its proximity to HABP2. HABP2 encodes FSAP, an extracellular serine proteinase that cleaves urinary plasminogen activator, coagulation factor VII, and tissue factor pathway inhibitor, and helps regulate coagulation, tissue remodeling and inflammation. Previous studies reported elevated levels of FSAP activity in patients with coronary artery disease and ischemic stroke. Rare genetic variants (e.g. the Marburg I polymorphism) in HABP2 have also been associated with increased risk of deep venous thrombosis, carotid stenosis, and stroke. Recent animal studies have also suggested that FSAP activity may modulate stroke-associated brain injury.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 20238, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Although the locus associated with early-onset ischemic stroke in our study is located in an intergenic region ~253 kb away from HABP2, several of the associated SNPs are predicted to have regulatory properties and associate with circulating levels of FSAP, implicating a possible mechanism leading to increased risk of early-onset stroke via HABP2. Interestingly, the previously known Marburg I polymorphism in HABP2 (rs7080536), showed no association with early-onset stroke in our analysis (data not shown). Further studies are needed to identify the causal variant(s) tagged by these associated SNPs as well as their functional properties leading to the increased risk of early-onset stroke. In contrast to most of the previously known stroke-relevant loci, our data are consistent with this 10q25 locus being associated with multiple stroke subtypes, a finding consistent with the possible thrombotic mechanism of HABP2 that can lead to increased coagulation and therefore susceptibility across the different stroke subtypes.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 21269, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Our study also suggests that the effects of the 10q25 locus may be specific to (or at least more pronounced in) early-onset stroke because the association was largely absent in METASTROKE studies, which consisted of predominantly older stroke cases. Unfortunately, we did not have access to large case-control cohorts consisting of stroke cases >60 years only, and therefore, we were unable to compare the allele frequency of rs11196288 between younger and older stroke cases directly to assess its effect on age of stroke onset. However, even within METASTROKE, there is a hint of an age-dependency with the locus effect appearing strongest in the study with the youngest mean age of onset (i.e. ARIC, mean age=57.3 years, OR=1.51) and weakest in the study with the oldest mean age of stroke onset (i.e., CHS, mean age=81.6 years, OR=0.67). An age-dependency for genetic effects would be parallel to prior reports that other risk factors may have large effects in younger versus older-onset stroke.

However, even including 4,500 early-onset stroke cases, we were unable to identify any subtype-specific stroke susceptibility loci in this early-onset stroke population using genome-wide association approach, possibly due to the small number of cases within each stroke subtype. Obtaining sufficient early-onset cases within each stroke subtype remains a significant challenge in future studies, and collaborative efforts will be needed to overcome this limitation. In the European GWAS analysis, we failed to replicate F5, a key protein in the coagulation pathway, as an early-onset stroke susceptibility locus. Previous evidence from candidate gene studies has long suggested that genetic variants of F5 predispose to stroke, the most conspicuous example being the Factor V Leiden (FVL) variant. However, a recent large-scale meta-analysis suggested that the reported association between FVL and early-onset IS was more pronounced among studies where cases were selected on the basis of having cryptogenic stroke or recruited from a subset of patients referred for a thrombophilic work-up and the FVL-stroke association is much smaller among studies with unselected cases. This may explain the lack of consistent results observed in our GWAS because cases included in our analyses were unselected and thus the genetic effect may be less prominent.
