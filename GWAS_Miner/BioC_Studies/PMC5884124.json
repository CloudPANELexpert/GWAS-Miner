We find that derived variants in SLC24A5 are at high frequency in the KhoeSan, including missense mutations that influence skin and eye pigmentation (Table 2). Notably, these variants are segregating at higher frequency than expected by recent European admixture alone. Three possible evolutionary scenarios that may explain these elevated frequencies are: 1) these variants arose in southern Africa more than 100,000 years ago and were later selected for in Europeans after the out-of-Africa migration in response to northern UVR environments. Alternatively, 2) these variants arose in Europe/Near East, were introduced into KhoeSan populations via \"back to Africa\" migration into southern Africa predating 17th century European colonialism, and have since been positively selected in the KhoeSan.

In contrast, tanning status is primarily environmental, with heritability estimates which are not significantly different from zero. In European populations, predictive models based on only 9 SNPs capture up to 16% of the variance in skin pigmentation, highlighting its relative simplicity. We applied a predictive model based on these SNPs to the Nama and  Khomani San populations, and find no significant association between predicted skin color and spectrophotometrically measured skin M index, showing that this estimation fails to capture the genetic variation driving the phenotype in the KhoeSan. Given the large effect sizes and high fraction of variation explained in Eurasian populations, we asked whether and how much of the phenotypic variation can be explained by previously identified genes. All gene sets, including previously associated loci, canonical pigmentation genes, and the most significantly associated variants in this study, explained a small fraction of the phenotypic variance (sigma2GS1=0.08, sigma2GS2=0.09, sigma2GS3=0.23, respectively). As expected from previous work, our results indicate that genetic risk prediction is strongly affected by population structure. Most of the pigmentation variability in KhoeSan populations is not explained by previously identified loci, suggesting that more than 50 loci (and indeed, likely far more, given our genomic heritability estimates) with a distribution of mostly small effects contribute to variation in pigmentation in the KhoeSan.

We also observe that populations with lighter skin have reduced variation within any given study: populations furthest from the equator have narrower distributions, while populations closest to the equator have wider distributions. These patterns suggest that selection is acting differently at different latitudes. In equatorial regions, strong directional selection for darker pigmentation has shifted the distribution means in some populations to M indices greater than 90, but with wide variances. This is consistent with a 'threshold' model in which the protective benefit of melanin needs to meet some minimum threshold but with no penalty to darker pigmentation; alternatively, diversifying selection could maintain the wide variance.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 36265, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "In stark contrast, pigmentation in far northern European and Asian populations has been under directional selection for decreased melanin production, reflected by very narrow distributions.

The Nama and  Khomani San appear to be two such instances of this intermediate variation within Africa, likely attributable to their geographic distance from the equator in far southern Africa (~24-29 degrees South). The observed mean and variance differences across the full spectrum of skin pigmentation by latitude may be driven by imbalanced opposing adaptive pressures, where selective forces to produce vitamin D and protect folate from photolysis are unequal and change in response to UV radiation exposure. Given our heritability results and the observed variability in baseline pigmentation; light skin pigmentation in the KhoeSan appears to be due to a combination of many small-effect mutations as well as some large-effect variants. The evolution of the pigmentation phenotype in these populations cannot be explained in terms of only a few variants segregating in Eurasians.

Even in light to moderately pigmented KhoeSan populations, the polygenicity of skin pigmentation is much greater than Eurasians, encompassing both known pigmentation genes as well as novel loci. We argue that the distributions of skin pigmentation globally suggest different forces of selection operating at various latitudes.

We do not replicate the vast majority of previously observed skin pigmentation associations in our dataset, potentially due to low frequencies in the KhoeSan, power limitations, differentiated LD structure in which the tag SNPs are non-causal pigmentation alleles, or epistatic effects.

Next, we assessed concordance similarly across all 79 individuals for whom we have both genotype and high coverage exome sequencing data (see Figure S4).

SMARCA2 has a known role in folate biosynthesis, in vitamin D-coupled transcription regulation, and is differentially expressed across CEU and YRI populations in lymphoblastoid cell lines. Additionally, previous functional studies have shown that MITF, the transcription factor known as the \"master regulator of melanogenesis\" due to its ability to activate many melanocyte-specific genes, recruits critical components of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex (including SMARCA2), to the promoter region of its targets. This recruitment is required for normal expression of many MITF target genes, including TYR, TYRP1, DCT, RAB27A, BCL2, among others. Additionally, VLDLR knockout mice exhibit hypopigmented retinas. We also find a suggestive association upstream of TYRP1 (Figure 5A, Figure S6G).
