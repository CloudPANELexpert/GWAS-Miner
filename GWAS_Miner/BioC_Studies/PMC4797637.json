Mice overexpressing either DDAH1 or DDAH2 show equally reduced ADMA levels and enhanced NO synthesis. However, we recently reported that DDAH1 is the major isoform involved in ADMA degradation based on studies in tissue-selective endothelial DDAH1 knockout mice. One of the SNPs most strongly associated with ADMA in the present GWAS was rs1554597 located in intron 1 of DDAH1. Caplin and co-workers identified a regulatory sequence within intron 1 in the DDAH1 gene associated with the rate of decline of glomerular filtration rate in subjects with chronic kidney disease, along with decreased DDAH1 mRNA expression and elevated ADMA plasma concentration.

Our finding that AGXT2 expressed in kidney cells metabolizes SDMA in a manner regulated by gene variants of AGXT2 rs37369 supports this hypothesis and may hint to a pathophysiological link between SDMA, renal function, and cardiovascular outcome. The AGXT2 rs37369 variant is located in the coding region of the gene, and in-silico modeling showed distinct similarity of this SNP to a coding variant in the AGXT1 gene which disrupts activity of the encoded enzyme and causes type 1 hyperoxaluria.

A gene overlapping MED23 is ARG1, which codes for one of two arginase subtypes that regulate L-arginine bioavailability. The ARG1 SNPs (rs2248551) identified in this analysis is in LD with one ARG1 SNP (rs2781168) which is part of a haplotype previously found to be associated with an increased risk for myocardial infarction in humans. One of the biological functions of arginase may lie in the regulation of NO synthesis by competing with NO synthase for the common substrate, L-arginine. For example, in activated macrophages utilization of L-arginine by the inducible isoform of NOS (iNOS) is limited by arginase activity, resulting in a suppressed cytotoxic response of these cells.

This hypothesis is supported by the lack of association between AGXT2 variants and total mortality in the CHARGE consortium after exclusion of stroke as a cause of death. Our finding is also in line with a recent analysis showing that none of the AGXT2 variants were associated with cardiovascular and overall mortality in the Ludwigshafen Risk and Cardiovascular Health Study. However, in that study a possible link between AGXT2 variants, renal function, and outcome was not considered. Our data may explain a relationship between AGXT2 genotype and long-term mortality following acute ischemic stroke, potentially mediated through the indirect link between AGXT2, SDMA, and renal function.
