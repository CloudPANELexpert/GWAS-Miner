Although neuroendocrine tumors are in some cases associated with inherited genetic syndromes, such syndromes are rare. The majority of neuroendocrine tumors are thought to be sporadic. We performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) to identify potential genetic risk factors for sporadic neuroendocrine tumors. Using germline DNA from blood specimens, we genotyped 909,622 SNPs using the Affymetrix 6.0 GeneChip, in a cohort comprising 832 neuroendocrine tumor cases from Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Massachusetts General Hospital and 4542 controls from the Harvard School of Public Health. An additional 241 controls from Dana-Farber Cancer Institute were used for quality control. We assessed risk associations in the overall cohort, and in neuroendocrine tumor subgroups. We identified no potential risk associations in the cohort overall. In the small intestine neuroendocrine tumor subgroup, comprising 293 cases, we identified risk associations with three SNPs on chromosome 12, all in strong LD. The three SNPs are located upstream of ELK3, a transcription factor implicated in angiogenesis. We did not identify clear risk associations in the bronchial or pancreatic neuroendocrine subgroups. This large-scale study provides initial evidence that presumed sporadic small intestine neuroendocrine tumors may have a genetic etiology.

Neuroendocrine tumors are characterized by well-differentiated morphologic features and the ability to secrete neuropeptides, resulting in characteristic clinical syndromes. The best known of these syndromes is the carcinoid syndrome, which is characterized by excess secretion of serotonin and the development of flushing, diarrhea and right-sided valvular heart disease. Neuroendocrine tumors arising in the pancreas are categorized as 'pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors' or 'islet cell tumors' and comprise approximately 10% of neuroendocrine tumors. Neuroendocrine tumors arising in other anatomic locations are generally described as 'carcinoid tumors'. The most common sites for carcinoid tumors are the lungs and bronchi, which account for up to 30% of all neuroendocrine tumors, with small intestine, appendix and rectal carcinoid tumors comprising the majority of the remaining sites.

An institutional analysis of 243 carcinoid cases, as well as an initial population-based analysis of a Swedish Family-Cancer Database comprising 10.2 million individuals, identified increased incidence rates of carcinoid tumors in first-degree relatives. A subsequent, more recent analysis of the Swedish database confirmed the increased risk in first-degree relatives of individuals with carcinoid tumors, reporting a relative risk of 4.33. Another study, combining family cancer datasets from Sweden and Finland, provided specific evidence of familial associations in individuals with small intestine carcinoid tumors: siblings of individuals with small intestine carcinoid tumors had a 30-fold higher risk of developing the same condition, and parents or children a 10-fold increased risk.

The identification of only a single associated SNP in lung neuroendocrine tumors not located in any known gene and without other associated confirming SNPs suggests this finding may be spurious and should be interpreted with caution. Our analysis of the small intestine neuroendocrine tumor subgroup, on the other hand, revealed three associated SNPs, all in strong linkage disequilibrium on chromosome 12q23. These SNPs are not located on any known gene, though they are in close proximity to ELK3 (Net), a gene implicated in transcriptional regulation of angiogenesis. Evaluation of the Genevar database suggested that these SNPs are potentially associated with the expression of ELK3, albeit in a different (lymphoblastoid) cell type. In mouse studies, ELK3 is expressed at sites of angiogenesis during early development; both phosphorylated ELK3 and VEGF are coexpressed in human tumors. The finding of a potential association with angiogenesis is particularly intriguing in light of the fact that neuroendocrine tumors are characterized by abundant vasculature, and are responsive to inhibitors of the VEGF pathway. Von Hippel-Lindau disease, one of the inherited cancer syndromes associated with the development of neuroendocrine tumors, is caused by germline mutations in VHL. VHL functions, in part, by regulating the degradation of HIF1A (hypoxia inducible factor 1A), a transcription factor that induces the expression of a number of genes implicated in angiogenesis. Mutations in EPAS1 (hypoxia inducible factor 2A), a homologous gene transcription factor also implicated in angiogenesis, have been reported in pheochromocytoma. The three SNPs identified on chromosome 12q23 are also in proximity to two other genes, LTAH4 and HAL, though whether these genes could be implicated in the development of neuroendocrine tumors is not clear. LTAH4 is a gene encoding leukotriene A4 hydrolase, an amino acid peptidase involved in arachidonic acid metabolism, and has been linked to the development of emphysema.
