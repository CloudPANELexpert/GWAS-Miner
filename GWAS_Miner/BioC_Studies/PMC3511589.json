We previously characterized a unique founder population in an isolated Romanian community with elevated prevalence of generalized vitiligo and other autoimmune diseases, including autoimmune thyroid disease, rheumatoid arthritis, and type I diabetes mellitus. Here, we describe a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of generalized vitiligo in 32 distantly related affected patients from this remote village and 50 healthy controls from surrounding villages. Vitiligo was significantly associated with single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in a 30-kb LD block on chromosome 6q27, in close vicinity to IDDM8, a linkage and association signal for type I diabetes mellitus and rheumatoid arthritis. The region of association contains only one gene, SMOC2, within which SNP rs13208776 attained genome-wide significance for association with generalized vitiligo (P = 8.51x10-8) at odds ratio 7.445 (95% confidence interval=3.56-15.53) for the high-risk allele and population attributable risk 28.00.
