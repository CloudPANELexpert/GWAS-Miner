A reduced function variant of BCRP, which acts as a secretory transporter in the kidney and intestine, should lead to decreased elimination and higher systemic plasma levels of the drug. Thus, a greater SUA reduction would be predicted. Since plasma levels of allopurinol and oxypurinol were not available, the precise mechanism by which the variant causes a reduced response to allopurinol cannot be determined. Although speculative, it is possible that allopurinol and oxypurinol have effects on SUA in addition to xanthine oxidase inhibition. For example, they could act as uricosurics, increasing the renal excretion of UA. In fact, hyperuricemic mice treated with allopurinol have an increased fractional excretion of UA, consistent with uricosuric action. Further, studies in Xenopus laevis oocytes demonstrate that oxypurinol is a potent inhibitor of human SLC2A9, a UA reabsorptive transporter associated with hyperuricemia.Alternatively, oxypurinol may competitively inhibit UA reabsorption via URAT1, which transports both UA and oxypurinol. Thus, oxypurinol in the tubule fluid might inhibit SLC2A9 or URAT1, leading to reduced reabsorption and increased renal excretion of UA, and ultimately to enhanced pharmacologic response. A reduced function variant of BCRP would then lead to decreased drug concentrations in the tubule fluid and thus reduced inhibition of UA reabsorptive transporters and diminished response. If true, either of these possibilities suggests an important mechanism of action for allopurinol, distinct from xanthine oxidase inhibition, and a way of modulating that mechanism. That is, oxypurinol and allopurinol inhibit UA reabsorptive transporters, and BCRP can control their ability to do so. Clearly, further research, including the study of rare reduced function variants in ABCG2, will enhance our understanding of the effects of ABCG2 in modulating the response to allopurinol.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 10755, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "One complication in interpreting our findings is that BCRP could have simply been affecting SUA through effects on baseline values.
