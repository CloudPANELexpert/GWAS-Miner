We also found that in Iceland, each copy of rs75932628-T was associated with an age at onset of Alzheimer's disease that was lower by 3.18 years than in controls without the variant (P = 0.20). Although this effect was similar to that of ApoE epsilon4 (3.22 years; P = 4.1x10-8), it was not significant, owing to the low frequency of the variant, which resulted in a reduced effective sample size and an elevated standard error (2.49 for rs75932628-T vs. 0.58 for ApoE epsilon4).

Furthermore, knock-down of TREM2 or DAP12 in microglia resulted in reduced phagocytosis of apoptotic neurons, whereas the overexpression of TREM2 increased such phagocytosis, suggesting that microglia recognize and phagocytose apoptotic neurons through TREM2 ligation.
