However, as the disease progresses, deficits can also be observed in other cognitive domains such as judgment, orientation, executive function, visuospatial ability, and language. Language impairment is a prevalent clinical feature that often occurs early on - sometimes even before AD is diagnosed, and progresses during the course of the disease. Several language tests have been shown to discriminate between cognitively normal (CN) and those with AD. Hence, language impairment is one of several areas of cognitive decline that can aid in the clinical diagnosis of AD dementia according to the most recent criteria.

Other memory systems affected include episodic memory, one of the earliest and most severely affected systems in AD. Language impairments in prodromal and clinical AD have been previously associated with cortical atrophy predominantly in left temporal and parietal lobe regions, in addition to several other brain regions. Similarly, there are functional changes on semantic fMRI tasks manifest early stage AD. The genetic factors that contribute to different modalities of language function have also been investigated in adolescents and young adults with and without language disorders. For example, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified candidate genes related to reading and language in adolescents to young adults and the morphology of Heschl's gyrus in young adults.
