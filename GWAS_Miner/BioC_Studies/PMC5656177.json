We investigated heritability estimates of the Eye Test in two samples. In our sample of 749 twin individuals (which included 122 complete MZ pairs and 176 complete DZ pairs), heritability was approximately 0.28 (95% CI: 0.13-0.42). This is in keeping with previous studies that have investigated heritability of other facets of empathy in twins. A meta-analysis of empathy in twins identified that approximately a third of the variance is heritable. In our sample of 88,056 unrelated research volunteers from 23andMe Inc, SNP-based heritability was estimated using LDSR, and approximately 5% of the trait was additively heritable. It is likely that heritability of cognitive empathy changes with age (which was significantly correlated with scores on the Eyes Test in this dataset), as is observed in prosocial behaviour. In our analyses, age was included as a covariate, and thus our SNP heritability is likely to represent the lower bound of the SNP heritability.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 23428, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "We identified significant positive genetic correlations with different measures of cognitive ability including educational attainment.

A meta-analysis identified a significant positive correlation between scores on the Eyes Test and IQ (n = 3583; r = 0.24; 95% CI: 0.16 - 0.32), perhaps reflecting that the Eyes Test has a verbal component that includes a varied mental state lexicon (matching a mental state word to an emotional expression). Other tests of theory of mind are also positively correlated with cognitive aptitude and measures of intelligence. This may reflect that theory of mind, and in particular joint attention in infancy, may facilitate language development and learning from others. Theory of mind may also be related to cognitive aptitude and IQ because we often infer another person's mental state through their speech - speech is the 'print-out' of a person's mind - so verbal IQ and language skills may facilitate theory of mind and vice versa. We also found a significant positive genetic correlation with the NEO-Openness to experience which likely reflects a previous correlation at a phenotypic level between measures of empathy and personality. With psychiatric conditions, there was a significant positive correlation with anorexia, which we identified using two non-independent datasets. One study identified that individuals with anorexia report higher personal distress, a subscale on a widely used measure of empathy, whilst other studies have reported that deficits in social cognition in anorexia may be attributable to comorbid alexithymia. Our research suggests that a higher genetic contribution to cognitive empathy increases one's genetic risk for anorexia.

This may be due to heterogeneity in performance in the Eyes Test, since only a subset of individuals with autism show impaired performance on the Eyes Test. In addition, the cognitive phenotype of autism involves non-social aspects (such as excellent attention to detail), not just social deficits. A meta-analysis reported global or selective deficits in performance on the Eyes Test in individuals with schizophrenia, anorexia, bipolar disorder, and clinical depression, but preserved or even enhanced performance for individuals with non-clinical depression and borderline personality disorder. However, these studies are typically conducted in small sample sizes.

In humans, the ventral striatum is composed of the nucleus accumbens and olfactory tubercle, whereas the dorsal striatum is composed of the caudate nucleus and putamen. There is some evidence to support the role of the striatum in theory of mind, and further research is need to confirm that cognitive and affective empathy utilize different neural circuits.

However, we were unable to identify any eQTL that specifically linked this locus to the gene. LRRN1 is a gene that is not well characterized. In chicks, Lrrn1 is necessary for the formation of the mid-brain hind-brain boundary. The locus was significant in females, nominally significant in the non-stratified analyses, and non-significant in the males-only analyses, suggesting a sex specific involvement of this locus in cognitive empathy measured using the Eyes Test. We note that even with approximately 90,000 individuals this GWAMA was underpowered to detect loci of significant effect, owing to the relatively low variance explained per SNP.

Sex-stratified analyses also allowed us to investigate the genetic correlation between males and females, and subsequently, sex-specific imputed gene expression in cortical tissues. Male-female genetic correlation was only modest, which was supported by a binomial sign test. In comparison, other traits for which we had sex-stratified data, genetic correlation was considerably higher (e.g., self-reported empathy: rg = 0.82, sd =0.16, systemizing: rg = 1.0, sd = 0.16 ; educational attainment : rg = 0.91, sd = 0.02). We also did not identify a significant overlap between the genes identified for the sex-stratified GWAS.

Genome-wide association meta-analysis was performed on the combined cohort of 89553 participants. Three separate meta-analyses were performed: males-only, females-only, and non-stratified. Subsequently, functional enrichment and gene-based analysis was performed for the non-stratified meta-analysis GWAS using the 23andMe dataset. SNP heritability and genetic correlation using LDSR was performed for the 23andMe GWAS dataset. Sex differences were also investigated using the same dataset.
