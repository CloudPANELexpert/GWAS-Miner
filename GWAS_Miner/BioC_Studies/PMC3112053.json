Recently, the prokaryotic leucine transporter homologue (LeuTaa) of SLC6A15 has been crystallized from Aquifex aeolicus and was shown to bind tricyclic antidepressant drugs that can directly block leucine transport by closing the molecular gate for the substrate in a non-competitive manner. Due to the high degree of phylogenetic conservation of the antidepressant binding site, these drugs probably also bind to the human transporter.

The associated region did not map to any known gene (compare with 2B). The flanking next genes to the region of association are SLC6A15 (+287 kb), a solute carrier family 6 gene that codes for a sodium-dependent branched amino acid transporter with high gene expression in neurons of the brain and TMTC2 (-989 kb), the transmembrane and tetratricopeptide repeat containing 2 gene of unknown function (see also tab. S1).
