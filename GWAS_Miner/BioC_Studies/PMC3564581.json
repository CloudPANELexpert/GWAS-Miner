However, PSA levels are affected by a number of factors apart from neoplasia. Notably, around 40% of the variability of PSA levels in the general population is accounted for by inherited factors, suggesting that it may be possible to improve both sensitivity and specificity by adjusting test results for genetic effects. In order to search for sequence variants that associate with PSA levels, we performed a genome-wide association study and follow-up analysis using PSA information from 15,757 Icelandic and 454 British men not diagnosed with prostate cancer. Overall, we detected a genome-wide significant association between PSA levels and SNPs at six loci: 5p15.33 (rs2736098), 10q11 (rs10993994), 10q26 (rs10788160), 12q24 (rs11067228), 17q12 (rs4430796), and 19q13.33 (rs17632542 (KLK3: I179T), each with Pcombined < 3x10-10.

Assessment of association between the 6 loci and prostate cancer risk in 5,325 cases and 41,417 controls from Iceland, the Netherlands, Spain, Romania, and the US showed that the SNPs at 10q26 and 12q24 were exclusively associated with PSA levels, whereas the other 4 loci also were associated with prostate cancer risk.

Early diagnosis and treatment are key factors in determining the survival and prognosis of prostate cancer patients, prompting intensive searches for biomarkers for screening. Currently, measuring serum levels of prostate specific antigen (PSA) is the only accepted screening method for the disease. PSA levels in the range of 2.5 ng/mL to 4 ng/mL are commonly used as a threshold when deciding whether to perform a biopsy of the prostate. However, despite the widespread use of the PSA screening test, it is limited both in specificity and sensitivity and substantial controversy exists over its benefits for patients. This is mainly due to the fact that PSA is not a specific marker of prostate cancer as its levels in serum increase in benign prostatic hyperplasia and are affected by many other factors such as medications, urological manipulations and inflammation. Notably, it has been shown that 33% of men with PSA levels above 10 ng/ml had no evidence of prostate cancer at biopsy and in a recent study the fraction of men with PSA levels above 10 ng/ml and no evidence of prostate cancer at biopsy was 47%. Furthermore, not all individuals with prostate cancer have raised levels of PSA. By performing a biopsy on a set of individuals not selected for PSA levels, Thompson and colleagues showed that 63% of prostate cancer patients (even prostate cancer with Gleason score >= 7) have PSA levels lower than 3 ng/ml.

These trials are expected to establish whether screening has an effect on prostate cancer mortality. The first results from these studies which were published last year showed either no or a small reduction in prostate cancer-specific mortality in the PSA-screened groups.. Since then, it has been suggested that the initial reports from these trials may have underestimated the beneficial effect of PSA screening as recent publications report that PSA testing leads to a relative reduction of prostate cancer metastasis of 53% and to a relative reduction of prostate cancer mortality close to 50%.

Such a model would have to take into account age, as the prevalence of both benign and malignant conditions that can cause serum PSA elevation increases with age. Sequence variants are also important when determining personal \"normal\" PSA levels, as it has been shown that expression of a large percentage of genes is under genetic control of both cis and trans components. Importantly, it has been shown that between 40% and 45% of the variability in PSA levels among men in the general population can be accounted for by inherited factors. However, because these factors are largely unknown, it has not been possible to adjust for them when interpreting the PSA results for a given individual. Recently, a variant (rs2735839-G) was discovered near the KLK3 gene (which encodes PSA) that was shown to predispose to prostate cancer (odds ratio OR= 1.2). However, it was subsequently shown that this variant associates with increased levels of PSA in men not diagnosed with prostate cancer. Hence, the reported risk of prostate cancer conferred by the variant may be mediated principally through its effect on PSA levels. By correcting for this variant, as well as additional sequence variants that affect PSA levels, both the sensitivity and the specificity of the PSA screening test could be improved. This prompted us to perform a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of sequence variants affecting population variation in PSA levels.

Using the Icelandic and the UK study groups of men who had been biopsied, we compared the frequency of the PSA variants in positive and negative biopsies. Of the six loci, we found that for the three PSA variants not primarily associated with prostate cancer risk (KLK3, FGFR2 and TBX3), the alleles associated with increased PSA levels are significantly less frequent among men with a positive biopsy than in men with a negative biopsy (rs10788160-A near FGFR2 has ORcombined = 0.79 and Pcombined =5.4x10-6, rs11067228-A near TBX3has ORcombined = 0.87 and Pcombined = 0.0034, rs17632542-T in KLK3 has ORcombined = 0.77 and Pcombined = 0.013; see Table 2 and Table S14 for full details).
