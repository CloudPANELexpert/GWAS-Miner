In addition to replicating previous findings, we identified a novel locus associated with T2D at genome-wide significance spanning the solute carriers SLC16A11 and SLC16A13 (P=3.9x10-13; odds ratio (OR)=1.29). The association was stronger in younger, leaner people with T2D, and replicated in independent samples (P=1.1x10-4; OR=1.20). The risk haplotype carries four amino acid substitutions, all in SLC16A11; it is present at  50% frequency in Native American samples and  10% in East Asian, but rare in European and African samples. Analysis of an archaic genome sequence indicated the risk haplotype introgressed into modern humans via admixture with Neandertals. The SLC16A11 mRNA is expressed in liver, and V5-tagged SLC16A11 protein localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum. Expression of SLC16A11 in heterologous cells alters lipid metabolism, most notably causing an increase in intracellular triacylglycerol levels.
