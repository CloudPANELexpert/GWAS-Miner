Moreover, family members of individuals with MPN are at higher risk for the development of MPN, consistent with the existence of MPN predisposition loci. We hypothesized that germline variation contributes to MPN predisposition and phenotypic pleiotropy.

A recent analysis of 32 candidate SNPs in MPN tumor samples identified three SNPs in JAK2 that were enriched in polycythemia vera; although these results suggest there are host genetic variants that influence MPN phenotype, the findings are likely influenced by the high rate of somatic isodisomy at the JAK2 locus in polycythemia vera.

The GG/CC genotype at JAK2 rs10974944 contributes significantly to the excess familial risk of MPN (OR = 2.80) with a population attributable risk of 46.0%. The high population attributable risks for these predisposi-tion alleles reflect gene-gene and gene-environment interactions, and the familial relative risks due to these variants are much smaller, for example, less than 3% for CLL.

There may be haplotype-specific variation in a regulatory motif or genotype-specific splicing that increases the selective advantage of the JAK2V617F allele when it is acquired on the predisposition haplotype. Alternatively, it is possible that genotype-specific genomic variation in the JAK2 haplotype block increases the somatic mutation rate at this locus, as has been observed for germline variants in the APC gene present in the Ashkenazi Jewish population that increase the rate of somatic APC mutations. Although alternate activating JAK2 muta-tions have been identified in acute leukemia samples and cell lines, the JAK2V617F allele overwhelmingly predominates in polycythemia vera, essential thrombocythema and primary myelofibrosis.
