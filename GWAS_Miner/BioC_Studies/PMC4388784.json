Studies from both stages were combined in a trans-ethnic meta-analysis. Confirmed loci were examined for putative functional and biological relevance. Eight loci, including six novel loci, met GW-significance (log10Bayes-factor>5.64) with per allele effect sizes of 0.03-0.14 cups/day. Six are located in or near genes potentially involved in pharmacokinetics (ABCG2, AHR, POR, CYP1A2) and pharmacodynamics (BDNF, SLC6A4) of caffeine. Two map to GCKR and MLXIPL, genes related to metabolic traits but lacking known roles in coffee consumption. Enhancer and promoter histone marks populate the regions of many confirmed loci and several potential regulatory SNPs are highly correlated with the lead SNP of each. SNP alleles near GCKR, MLXIPL, BDNF and CYP1A2 that were associated with higher coffee consumption have previously been associated with smoking initiation, higher adiposity and fasting insulin and glucose but lower blood pressure and favorable lipid, inflammatory and liver enzyme profiles (P<5x10-8).Our genetic findings among European and African American adults reinforce the role of caffeine in mediating habitual coffee consumption and may point to molecular mechanisms underlying inter-individual variability in pharmacological and health effects of coffee.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 1872, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "INTRODUCTION", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 1885, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Coffee is amongst the most widely consumed beverages in the world. North American coffee drinkers typically consume ~2 cups per day while the norm is at least 4 cups in many European countries. In prospective cohort studies, coffee consumption is consistently associated with lower risk of Parkinson's disease, liver disease and type 2 diabetes. However, the effects of coffee on cancer development, cardiovascular and birth outcomes and other health conditions remain controversial. For most populations, coffee is the primary source of caffeine, a stimulant also present in other beverages, foods and medications. The fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders does not include a diagnosis of caffeine dependence or abuse due to a paucity of evidence but lists caffeine intoxication and withdrawal as Disorders. Knowledge of factors contributing to coffee's consumption and physiological effects may greatly advance the design and interpretation of population and clinical research on coffee and caffeine. Genetic factors could be especially valuable as they offer ways to study the potential health effects of coffee via instrumental variables or gene-environment interactions. Heritability estimates for coffee and caffeine use range between 36 and 58%. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of habitual caffeine and coffee intake have identified variants near CYP1A2 and AHR.

Loci near BDNF and SLC6A4 potentially impact consumption behavior by modulating the acute behavioral and reinforcing properties of caffeine. Others near AHR, CYP1A2, POR, and ABCG2 act indirectly by altering the metabolism of caffeine and thus the physiological levels of this stimulant. The strength of these four associations with coffee intake, along with results from pathway analysis showing significant enrichment for 'xenobiotic' genes, emphasize an especially pronounced role of caffeine metabolism in coffee drinking behavior. The current study is the first to link GCKR and MLXIPL variation to a behavioral trait. The nonsynonymous rs1260326 SNP in GCKR has been a GW-signal for various metabolic traits particularly those reflecting glucose-homeostasis (Table 3). GCKR variation may impact the glucose-sensing process of the brain that may, in turn, influence central pathways responding to coffee constituents. mQTL and binding motif analysis suggests PPM1G may be another candidate underlying the association between rs1260326 and coffee consumption. Variants near MLXIPL have also topped the list of variants associated with plasma triglycerides (Table 3), but their link to coffee consumption remains unclear. Future studies on the potential pleiotropic effects of these two loci are clearly warranted.
