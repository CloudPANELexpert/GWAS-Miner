It arises through multiple mechanisms, depending on the affected individual's underlying cardiac pathology. In the last decade, considerable progress has been made in understanding the genetic, molecular and electrophysiological basis of SCD in the uncommon (monogenic) familial arrhythmia syndromes affecting structurally normal hearts and the rare inherited structural disorders associated with increased SCD risk.
