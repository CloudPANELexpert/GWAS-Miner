Indeed, countless studies have been published documenting various deleterious outcomes associated with schizophrenia such as developmental abnormalities, impaired role functioning, cognitive deficits, and deviations in brain structure and processes.

Of considerable interest is what additional etiological insights might be gained by examining the molecular genetic basis of associated psychophysiological measures that appear to tap into the genetic liability for schizophrenia. Indeed, there have already been notable attempts along these lines (e.g., Consortium on the Genetics of Schizophrenia [COGS]) using candidate gene and whole genome linkage studies, as well as initiatives that provide the stimulus for such research (e.g., Research Domain Criteria [RDoC]). However, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of schizophrenia-related endophenotypes represent an underexploited opportunity to identify genetic variants linked to the disorder. This is due in part to the difficulty in collecting laboratory data from the large sample sizes required for genetic analyses. However, it remains unclear how large such samples need to be. Because endophenotypes are linked to brain processes that are posited to be more proximal to the effects of genes influencing psychopathology, there is a priori reason to believe that the effects of genetic variants may be detectable using samples considerably smaller than those used in GWAS with clinical diagnostic phenotypes (for examples, see the concluding comments in). Among the various criteria proposed for endophenotypes, of particular importance is evidence of stability over time, heritability, cosegregation with the illness, appearance in unaffected relatives, and ability to predict the development of disorder in longitudinal research :which several psychophysiological indices satisfy easily.
