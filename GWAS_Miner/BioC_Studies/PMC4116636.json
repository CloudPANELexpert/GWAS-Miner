In the first stage, 731,458 SNPs were genotyped in 1,497 cases and 1,008 controls using Illumina Human OmniExpress BeadChips.

Cochran's Q statistic was used to test for heterogeneity, and the I2 statistic was used to quantify the proportion of the total variation caused by heterogeneity. A random-effect model (DerSimonian-Laird) was adopted if there was an indication of heterogeneity between studies (P for Q <= 0.05); otherwise, the fixed-effect model was applied (P for Q > 0.05). A predefined P value of 5.0 x 10-8 was set as a threshold for genome-wide significance. In replication stages, association was assumed to be significant after Bonferroni correction, at P < 1.16 x 10-3 (0.05/43) or 0.025 (0.05/2) for replication 1 and 2, respectively. For regions that met the statistical criteria of genome-wide association with prostate cancer risk, ungenotyped SNPs were imputed using IMPUTE software (see URLs) with 1000 Genomes Project CHB and JPT subjects serving as reference haplotype maps. A posterior probability of >0.90 was applied to call imputed genotypes. Imputed SNPs were excluded if they had (i) a call rate of <95%; (ii) a MAF of <0.05; or (iii) P < 1 x 10-3 in a Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium test in controls. Conditional analysis was then applied to test the independence of SNPs in each region, using the SNPs that were originally determined to be significant as covariates. Regional plots were created using LocusZoom (see URLs). SAS 9.2 (SAS Institute) and R 2.9.1 (see URLs) were also used for data analysis.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 21853, "infons": {"section_type": "METHODS", "type": "title_2"}, "text": "eQTL analysis", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 21867, "infons": {"section_type": "METHODS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Two identified loci, rs817826 at 9q31.2 and rs103294 at 19q13.4, were tested for correlation with nearby gene expression, as measured by probes using the publicly available eQTL database Genevar (see URLs). Genotype and expression data within this database are derived from 3 cell types (fibroblast, lymphoblastoid cell line and T cell) from 75 individuals from Geneva and 3 tissue types (166 adipose, 156 lymphoblastoid cell line and 160 skin) from healthy female twins. The expression probes located within 1 Mb of the 5' and 3' end of the specified SNPs were analyzed. Differences in the distribution of normalized expression levels between genotypes were compared using a linear regression model. To avoid false positive associations due to multiple tests, we set a significance threshold of P < 1.0 x 10-3 and also assessed significance using 10,000-fold permutations. Specifically, two probes, ILMN_1786303 on exon 6 and ILMN_1661631 on exon 7 of LILRA3, were used in the measurement of LILRA3 expression.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 22886, "infons": {"section_type": "SUPPL", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "Supplementary Material", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 22909, "infons": {"section_type": "SUPPL", "type": "footnote"}, "text": "Note: Supplementary information is available in the online version of the paper.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 22990, "infons": {"section_type": "SUPPL", "type": "footnote"}, "text": "           AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS         ", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 23031, "infons": {"section_type": "SUPPL", "type": "footnote"}, "text": "Y.S., J.X. and Z.M. directed the study, obtained financial support and were responsible for study design, interpretation of results and manuscript writing.
