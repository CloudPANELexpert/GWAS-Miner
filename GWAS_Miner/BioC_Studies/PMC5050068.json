VAC14 has been directly linked to neurodegeneration in animal models and linked to hereditary neuropathy conditions in humans. The lack of clinical replication in a cohort of paclitaxel-treated breast cancer patients is perhaps due to known differences between the two taxanes, including neuropathy profile. Distinct genetic modifiers of cellular sensitivity to paclitaxel and docetaxel have been previously reported in in vitro models and the results of cellular sensitivity experiments demonstrating that VAC14 knockdown enhances sensitivity of peripheral neurons to docetaxel but not paclitaxel for relative number of processes and relative branching, further support this hypothesis. Given the distinct genetic effects on neuronal sensitivity to docetaxel and paclitaxel it is conceivable that the polymorphisms that affect neuropathy risk also differ between the two taxanes. This would be consistent with the lack of cross-study replication, including the lack of association with docetaxel-induced neuropathy occurrence in this analysis for SNPs (FGD4, EPHA4 and EPHA5) that have been previously discovered, and in some cases replicated, in paclitaxel-induced neuropathy GWAS. Alternatively, heterogeneity between the patient cohorts, including differences in gender, age, and functional status, or differences in the phenotype (grade 2+ vs. grade 3+), may explain the lack of replication across the clinical GWAS.

Interestingly, knockdown of VAC14 seemed to decrease cellular sensitivity to paclitaxel treatment for these morphological characteristics suggesting that this gene may play an important role in the damage to processes and branching induced by docetaxel but not paclitaxel. A similar model of human neuronal cell sensitivity that utilizes induced pluripotent cortical neurons (iCell  Neurons) has previously been used for mechanistic validation of GWAS hits that increases risk of paclitaxel-induced neuropathy and vincristine-induced neuropathy. These human model systems have several advantages over the use of rodent cell lines such as rat pheochromocytoma cell lines, PC12 or NS1.

Unlike the cell experiment, VAC14 heterozygous mice were not more sensitive than wild-type littermates to the effect of docetaxel, but were more sensitive to mechanical stimuli prior to treatment. The enhanced sensitivity in the heterozygous mice at baseline was attenuated over time in the untreated cohort, in both male and female mice. It is possible that these mice acclimate to the discomfort of the mechanical stimuli or they may be experiencing numbness, another characteristic symptom of peripheral neuropathy in taxane-treated patients, though additional experiments would be required to test either hypothesis. It is unclear from these findings whether patients with VAC14 polymorphisms have subclinical neuropathy at baseline that is expressed by treatment, as suggested by the mouse data, or whether they are similar at baseline and have greater neuropathy development from docetaxel treatment.

The inability of VAC14-/- homozygous mice to survive beyond 1-2 days after birth necessitated the use of VAC14+/- heterozygous mice. On autopsy AC14-/- homozygous mice exhibit massive neurodegeneration with cell bodies in the central and peripheral nervous system containing large vacuoles. This neurodegeneration and vacuolization are similar to that found in FIG4 null mice, suggesting that variation in these genes is likely to phenocopy in humans as well as in mice. A rare mutation in the FIG4 gene is known to cause a subtype of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, a hereditary neuropathy syndrome.

Furthermore, ordinal analysis across all neuropathy grades (0-4) would have brought greater statistical power and may have identified a distinct set of SNPs that predict neuropathy severity, similar to the paclitaxel-induced neuropathy GWAS findings in CALGB (Alliance) 40101.

However, the relatively low hazard ratio of this SNP suggests that no single variant or gene is responsible for dictating neuropathy sensitivity or will be clinically useful for personalizing docetaxel treatment.

Genetic predictors of paclitaxel-induced neuropathy have been discovered but little is known about whether similar genetic factors are associated with risk of docetaxel-induced neuropathy. Discovery of genetic predictors of docetaxel-induced neuropathy could inform personalized treatment decisions to maximize efficacy and avoid unnecessary toxicity. We conducted a genome-wide association study in a large cohort of Caucasian men with hormone refractory prostate cancer treated with docetaxel. One single nucleotide polymorphism in VAC14 that was significantly associated with docetaxel-induced neuropathy was then mechanistically validated in cellular and animal models of neurotoxicity. These finding suggest that distinct genetic variants influence risk of peripheral neuropathy from paclitaxel and docetaxel. The genetic variant identified in this study could be useful for understanding the mechanism of docetaxel-induced neuropathy and may be informative for avoiding docetaxel treatment in patients at elevated neuropathy risk.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}], "annotations": [], "relations": []}]}
