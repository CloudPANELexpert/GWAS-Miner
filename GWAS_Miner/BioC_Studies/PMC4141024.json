These analyses have led to the discovery of 9 genetic loci in Europeans, Asians and African Americans, some of which also confer an increased risk of atrial fibrillation. However, PR interval is the summation of P wave duration and PR segment, which are considered to reflect different aspects of the cardiac cycle. P wave duration reflects the electrical signals that propagate through the atria and can indicate atrial enlargement. The PR segment corresponds to the period that electrical signals are delayed at the atrioventricular (AV) node, before it travels through the ventricular branches to induce cardiac depolarization and may be prolonged during AV nodal dysfunction. It remains to be determined whether the previously identified PR-interval variants are driven by P wave duration, PR segment, or by both. Understanding the origin of these genetic associations can further refine our understanding of atrial and AV-node function. The aims of current study are to (1.) determine the association of the genetic variants identified by previous PR interval studies with P wave duration and PR segment (2.) determine whether genome-wide analyses of the sub-traits (PR segment and P wave duration) can lead to the identification of novel SNP-associations.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 3181, "infons": {"section_type": "METHODS", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "Methods", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 3189, "infons": {"section_type": "METHODS", "type": "title_2"}, "text": "Study samples", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 3203, "infons": {"section_type": "METHODS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Participants of the Prevention of Renal and Vascular End-Stage Disease (PREVEND) study and the Lifelines study cohort  were included.

Genome-wide significant SNPs were over-enriched in the active histone marks H3K27ac and H3K4me1 of the right atrium. In contrast, genome-wide significant loci were under-enriched in H3k9me3 of the right atrium, a mark that is associated with low levels of gene transcription. These results indicate that genome-wide significant loci are more active in the right atrium compared to other tissues, as expected. Furthermore, all available heart tissues were at least >=1 time considered to be over-enriched, as well as a few other tissues such as aorta, skeletal muscle and fibroblasts. B) To test the hypothesis that we identified regions actively transcribed in the right atrium and AV-node, we performed qPCR's of the nearest genes identified in the genome-wide analysis of this study in the right atrium, AV-node and left ventricle. Three groups of 7 pooled tissue samples were measured for the expression of each gene and were normalized to the expression of Gapdh. Error bars represent the standard deviation. Significance of difference (* and #) between the left ventricle and the right atria or AV-node was tested using a t-test. Six of the 11 tested candidate genes were significantly higher expressed in both the node and right atrium when compared to the left ventricle.
