None of the SNPs in linkage disequilibrium (r2>0.4) with rs2041570 were coding variants (Supplementary Table S6, Supplemental digital content 7, http://links.lww.com/EJGH/A300) but are all located in noncoding region of the genome, suggesting a possible regulatory function of this locus (Fig. 3a). We therefore performed cis-eQTL mapping using RNA-sequencing data and genotype data from 629 healthy-donor blood samples (LifeLines cohort) and observed that the risk allele A at rs2041570 was associated (P=0.01; Fig. 3b) with lower expression levels of FAM188B (family with sequence similarity 188, member B), a gene 315 kb distal of rs2041570 (Fig. 3a), but not with other genes encoded in the same region (Supplementary Table S7, Supplemental digital content 8, http://links.lww.com/EJGH/A301). When we combined the LifeLines cohort eQTL data with RNA-sequencing data from the 1000-Genomes project, we found strong replication (Meta-eQTL P= 0.008) of the effect of rs2041570 on FAM188B levels (Supplementary Table S7, Supplemental digital content 8, http://links.lww.com/EJGH/A301). We also confirmed these results in biopsies from patients with RCDII where the risk allele A also showed lower levels of expression of FAM188B (AA +AG vs. GG, P= 0.057; Fig. 3c), whereas expression levels of other genes in this locus were not associated with rs2041570 genotypes (Supplementary Fig. S3A, Supplemental digital content 2, http://links.lww.com/EJGH/A295 and Supplementary Fig. S3B, Supplemental digital content 2, http://links.lww.com/EJGH/A295).", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 21727, "infons": {"section_type": "RESULTS", "type": "title_2"}, "text": "Genotype-dependent expression analysis at rs2041570 implicates RCDII gene in intestinal innate immune function", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 21838, "infons": {"section_type": "RESULTS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Genotype-expression correlation analyses suggested FAM188B as a putative causal gene at rs2041570.

As the intestinal biopsies of the carriers of rs2041570*AA and rs2041570*GG genotypes are indistinguishable in cellular composition, the comparison of gene expression difference between genotypes helps us to exclusively extract the molecular pathways associated with the RCDII locus at 7p14.3. To enhance our understanding of the molecular pathways disrupted in RCDII that are caused by rs2041570, we stratified RCDII biopsies into rs2041570*AA and rs2041570*GG genotypes to identify differentially expressed genes (Supplementary Table S2, Supplemental digital content 3, http://links.lww.com/EJGH/A296). We found 26 genes showing an average of more than five-fold difference (P < 0.05) in expression, with 18 genes up-regulated and eight genes down-regulated in the samples carrying the rs2041570*AA risk genotype (Fig. 4a). Pathway enrichment analysis on these differentially expressed genes indicated a significant overrepresentation (P = 6.63 x 10-5) of genes for defense response to bacterium (Supplementary Table S8, Supplemental digital content 9, http://links.lww.com/EJGH/A302).", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 23199, "infons": {"section_type": "RESULTS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Interestingly, we found a dramatic nearly 60-fold up-regulation of the C20orf114 gene (Fig. 4b) in the biopsies carrying the rs2041570*AA risk genotype. In addition, we observed differential expression of many epithelial innate defense genes (TCN1, SERPINA5, MMP7, SCGB3A1,PGC, and SH2D1B). C20orf114, also known as BPIFB1, encodes for the long palate, lung, and nasal epithelium clone protein-1 (LPLUNC1). LPLUNC1 has been shown to be expressed in Paneth cells and to function as an innate immune modulator to Vibrio cholera infection. Furthermore, we found altered expression of multiple Paneth-cell-specific genes (DEFA1, DEFA5, DEFA6, and DEFB1) in an rs2041570-genotype-dependent manner (Fig. 4c). We then tested the expression specificity of FAM188B by querying the Human Protein Atlas portal (http://www.proteinatlas.org), we observed that FAM188B is expressed at low levels in tissues but ubiquitously. However, much stronger FAM188B expression was seen in the glandular cells of the intestine (Supplementary Fig. S4, Supplemental digital content 2, http://links.lww.com/EJGH/A295), suggesting that some of the glandular cells, for example, goblet or Paneth cells, may have higher FAM188B expression.

This has also been shown for Crohn's disease, in which SNPs at FOXO3A, XACT, IGFBP1-IGFBP3 and the MHC region were found to be significantly associated with disease prognosis but not associated with Crohn's disease susceptibility. In this study, we found no significant evidence for association of known CeD non-HLA loci with either susceptibility to or progression to RCDII, suggesting that different variants may contribute to prognosis of the disease. However, it is difficult to make this conclusion definite owing to very small sample size of RCDII as compared with big GWAS for CeD. Nevertheless, a genetic risk model using both HLA and the SNP rs2041570 significantly improved the risk estimation for progression to RCDII in patients with CeD (Fig. 2d), although the model needs to be tested in an independent RCDII cohort. In addition, these two currently known genetic loci are still insufficient to predict all the patients at increased risk of progression to RCDII, who therefore need to be closely monitored. Two other loci, rs7324708 and rs20547, also showed suggestive associations with RCDII (Fig. S2, Supplemental digital content 2, http://links.lww.com/EJGH/A295). These SNPs are located within the introns of KLF12 and SHISA6 genes, respectively. Future studies are needed to understand whether these genes are causally associated with RCDII or not.

We have previously shown that genotype-dependent response profiling can identify specific pathways altered by the risk allele, in which a critical role for CLEC12A in an ATG16L1 genotype-dependent manner was identified in Crohn's disease. When we applied a similar approach here, using RCDII biopsies, our data show that individuals carrying two copies of the rs2041570 risk allele have differential expression of many intestinal innate defense genes and antimicrobial defensins that may also play a role in Paneth cell function. Paneth cells are known to secrete granules containing bactericidal proteins like defensins and lysozyme, which in turn regulate the microbiome of the gut. This is an interesting observation as Paneth cell abnormalities have been suggested to play a role in RCD and in Crohn's disease. Given this important role of Paneth cells in Crohn's disease and a suggestive role in RCDII, it may be that these two conditions share a similar pathogenesis related to a disturbed interaction with intestinal microbiota. In addition, some of the gut innate immune genes that were expressed in a rs2041570-risk-genotype-dependent manner in RCDII biopsies were shown to be important for gut bacterial infections such as Vibrio cholera.

Butyrate-producing bacteria are assumed to play a role in gut health and their numbers are shown to be decreased in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. The association between the RCDII SNP and Roseburia inulinivorans in healthy individuals, although preliminary, supports a model in which patients with CeD can be pre-disposed to an altered gut microbiome owing to their genetics and thereby have an increased risk of developing RCDII. However, and not mutually exclusive, a primary defect in the epithelial cells and more specifically in their ability to control inflammation may play an important role in the development of RCDII. rs2041570 locus may contribute to maintain chronic inflammation in patients following strict gluten-free diet and, by this way, acquisition of oncogenetic events involved in lymphomagenesis. Besides HLA-DQ2 genotype, evidence of rs2041570 locus enlarges the spectrum of non-gluten-dependent mechanisms involved in RCDII pathogenesis. Combination of such various factors is concordant with the rarity of this malignant complication and the possibility of co-existing in the same family of both uncomplicated celiac and RCDII cases, as it was the case for at least two patients of the series.
