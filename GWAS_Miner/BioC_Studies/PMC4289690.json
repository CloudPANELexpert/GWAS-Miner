Genome-wide studies demonstrate a high degree of genetic overlap, but these diseases have mutually exclusive clinical phenotypes and opposing immune mechanisms. Despite their prevalence, atopic dermatitis and psoriasis very rarely co-occur within one individual. By utilizing genome-wide association study and ImmunoChip data from >19,000 individuals and methodologies developed from meta-analysis, we have identified opposing risk alleles at shared loci as well as independent disease-specific loci within the epidermal differentiation complex (chromosome 1q21.3), the Th2 locus control region (chromosome 5q31.1), and the major histocompatibility complex (chromosome 6p21-22). We further identified previously unreported pleiotropic alleles with opposing effects on atopic dermatitis and psoriasis risk in PRKRA and ANXA6/TNIP1. In contrast, there was no evidence for shared loci with effects operating in the same direction on both diseases. Our results show that atopic dermatitis and psoriasis have distinct genetic mechanisms with opposing effects in shared pathways influencing epidermal differentiation and immune response.

They are associated with a significantly reduced quality of life and multiple comorbidities. Both diseases result from the interaction of genetic and environmental factors and are characterized by epidermal defects as well as local and systemic immunological abnormalities. Despite a lifetime prevalence of ~2% for psoriasis and 10%-20% for AD, these diseases rarely co-occur within an individual:an observation attributed to opposing immune response patterns. However, it has been reported that both Th1-cell-dominated autoimmune and Th2-cell-dominated allergic diseases aggregate within families and that parental psoriasis might increase the risk of AD in offspring. Furthermore, genome-wide linkage and association studies have shown genetic risk loci in each disease that map to similar regions of the genome. The epidermal differentiation complex (EDC) on chromosome 1q21.3 includes AD and psoriasis risk loci in close proximity. Null mutations in the gene encoding filaggrin (FLG [MIM 135940]) represent the strongest known risk factor for AD and account for at least a proportion of AD risk within the EDC, but FLG-null mutations are not associated with psoriasis. A deletion of the late cornified envelope genes LCE3B-LCE3C (MIM 612614, 612615) represents a genetic substrate for psoriasis within the EDC, but this deletion is not associated with AD. The cytokine cluster encoded at 5q23.1-5q31.1 includes variants showing association with both diseases, and an intergenic region of chromosome 20q13.2 has also shown association with both AD and psoriasis.

We calculated p values for tests that were designed to be sensitive to the following situations: an overall SNV effect (on either or both diseases, in either direction), an individual SNV effect on one disease (but not on the other), a shared SNV effect (operating in the same direction for both diseases), and a contrasting SNV effect (operating in opposing directions between both diseases), by performing Wald tests of the following linear hypotheses:", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 14040, "infons": {"section_type": "METHODS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The overall significance of the SNV was assessed through the 2 degree of freedom (df) test of overall effect, which compares the null hypothesis that the SNV has no effect on either psoriasis or AD with the alternative hypothesis that it has an effect on one or both diseases.

The rationale for the use of the minimum of these 1 df tests for categorization is as follows: if a SNV is associated with one disease but not the other, the test of a nonzero regression coefficient for that disease (even while unnecessarily also allowing for a nonzero coefficient for the other disease, as is done in the psoriasis effect and AD effect tests), should be more powerful than a test that erroneously groups together the coefficients of the associated and the nonassociated disease (as is done in the shared and opposing effect tests). This is on account of the fact that grouping together these coefficients will incur a penalty in terms of increasing the variance, while not incurring any greater expected magnitude of effect since the expected value of the regression coefficient for the nonassociated disease is zero. If, on the other hand, the SNV has effects that operate in the same direction on both diseases, then a test based on adding together these effects (as is done in the shared effect test) should be more powerful than considering each effect on its own, or subtracting one effect from the other (as is done in the opposing effect test), because adding together the coefficients induces the greatest magnitude of effect.

The locus has previously been associated with psoriasis in European and Chinese populations but has not been implicated in AD. TNIP1 is involved in TNF signaling and regulation of the transcription factor NF-kappaB; it shows increased expression both in AD and psoriatic lesions compared to control skin. In contrast, ANXA6, which encodes a calcium-dependent membrane and phospholipid binding protein, shows significant upregulation of expression in atopic skin compared to control skin (fold change 1.3, FDR p = 0.016) and lesional to nonlesional AD skin (fold change 2.4, p = 0.027), whereas expression is decreased in psoriatic versus healthy skin (fold change 0.7, p = 6.38 x 10-13). Clearly, further fine mapping is necessary to identify the causal variant that exerts opposing effects on AD and psoriasis, but we speculate that ANXA6 might be a switch-point differentiating AD from psoriasis that reflects the importance of calcium-dependent effects in keratinocyte differentiation.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 22799, "infons": {"section_type": "RESULTS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Opposing effect loci were also identified within regions characterized by complex patterns of LD within the EDC (Figure S4), the cytokine cluster on 5q31.1 (Figures S4 and S5), and the MHC.
