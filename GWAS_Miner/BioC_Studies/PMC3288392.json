The region encompasses various regulatory features, including several DNAse-I hypersensitive sites and transcription factor binding sites and high levels of nuclear matrix attachment.;; Chromatin modifications in the region, including high levels of acetylation of histone 3 at lysine 27 (H3K27) and monomethylation at lysine 4 (H3K4) assessed in a lymphoblastoid cell line, are consistent with enhancer function (http://genome.ucsc.edu). Despite considerable genomic separation from the enhancer cluster (~1 MB telomeric), BCL11B is thought to be a target of one or more of the enhancers in this locus.;; BCL11B is located on the minus strand, positioning the enhancer cluster in the remote 3' region of the gene. The closest known gene in the opposite direction, VRK1, is ~1.1 MB centromeric to the enhancer cluster and is on the plus strand, again positioning the enhancer in the remote 3' region of VRK1, suggesting that one or both genes could potentially be targets of a remote 3' enhancer in this region.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 21003, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "In support of BCL11B as a target, numerous translocations have been described that insert fragments of 5q35 at various positions in a breakpoint cluster region that falls between the enhancer region and 3' BCL11B.

Su et al. used translocation data to map enhancer function to a 58 kB segment of the genome that corresponds to the telomeric shoulder of our locus of significant association with CFPWV.

There are several potential mechanisms for an effect of BCL11B on aortic stiffness. COUP-TFII (NR2F2) modulates the angiopoietin-1 and vascular endothelial growth factor pathways and plays a critical role in the development of the heart and great vessels. In addition, BCL11B is a C2H2 zinc finger protein that can directly bind DNA in a sequence specific manner. Acting in part through an interaction with SIRT1, BCL11B can effect transcriptional repression of various genes that may be relevant to aortic stiffness. In addition to direct effects of BCL11B on aortic function, there are potential indirect effects mediated through the known role that BCL11B plays in T-cell function. T-cell specific deletion of BCL11B at the CD4+ single positive stage is associated with increased numbers of proinflammatory T-cells that could potentially infiltrate the aorta and promote inflammation, fibrosis and stiffening.; Additional work will be required to establish the potential role that genetic variation in the chromosome 14 locus may play in BCL11B expression and aortic function.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 23413, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "We demonstrated that two overlapping ESTs that fall completely within the region of highly significant association with CFPWV are expressed in aortic tissue and cell lines.

One of the highly associated SNPs in the region (rs710285) is located in an exon of DB129663, suggesting a possible functional effect. The enhancer core region mapped by Su et al. corresponds to the putative promoter region of DB129663.

The locus on chromosome 10 with the second lowest P-value in our GWAS meta-analysis lies in the vicinity of a putative protein coding gene that may represent a novel member of the low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP) family. We found moderate evidence for association at the LRP4 locus, which is also associated with stroke and bone mineral density.; The LRP4 locus includes a nonsynonymous SNP (rs6485702) that has been related to bone mineral density, although a separate report involving several of our cohorts positioned the region of highest association with bone mineral density in the promoter region of ARHGAP1. Bone density and arterial stiffness are related phenotypes that may share many common pathways. The recently observed inhibitory role that LRP4 plays in Wnt signaling in bone coupled with the adverse effects of Wnt signaling in the aorta suggests that a mutation that impairs the ability of LRP4 to modulate the Wnt signaling cascade could simultaneously contribute to osteopenia and aortic stiffening. The chromosome 11 locus that encompasses LRP4 and additional potential candidates, including ARHGAP1 and F2, represents a long LD block that was also associated with stroke in a prior meta-analysis that included several of the cohorts in our study. The direction of effect in the prior study (higher risk for the minor allele) and ours (stiffer aorta with the minor allele) was consistent with the known association between increased CFPWV and increased risk for stroke. In addition, a prior family-based linkage analysis for myocardial infarction found a single significant linkage peak in the vicinity of our chromosome 14 locus.

We have also shown that genetic variation at this locus is associated with increased risk for major CVD events, providing strong support for the hypothesis that increased CFPWV contributes to the pathogenesis of CVD. We have shown that 2 potentially regulatory ncRNAs as well as flanking genes, BCL11B and VRK1, are expressed in human aorta. Further work will be required to define precise mechanisms mediating the association between CFPWV and genetic variation in the VRK1-BCL11B gene desert.
