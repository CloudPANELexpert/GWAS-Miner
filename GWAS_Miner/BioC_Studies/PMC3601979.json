Here we report our findings from a GWAs conducted in 536 early onset breast cancer patients aged 40 or less at diagnosis and with a mean follow-up period of 4.1 years (S.D=1.96). Patients were selected from the POSH (Prospective study of Outcomes in Sporadic versus Hereditary breast cancer). A Bonferroni correction for multiple testing determined that a p-value of 1.0 x 10-7 was a statistically significant association signal. Following QC we identified 487496 SNPs for association tests in stage-1. In stage 2, 35 SNPs with the most significant associations were genotyped in 1516 independent cases from the same early onset cohort. In stage-2, 11 SNPs remained associated in the same direction (p{less than or equal to}0.05). Fixed effects meta-analysis models identified one SNP associated at close to genome wide level of significance 556 kb upstream of the ARRDC3 locus HR=1.61 (1.33-1.96, p=9.5 x 10-7). Four further associations at or close to the PBX1, RORalpha, NTN1 and SYT6 loci also came close to genome wide significance levels (p=10-6). In the first ever GWAS for identification of SNPs associated with prognosis in early onset breast cancer patients we report a SNP upstream of the ARRDC3 locus as potentially associated with prognosis (Median follow-up time for genotypes CC=4 years, CT=3 years and TT=2.7 years, Wilcoxon rank sum test CC vs. CT, p=4 x 10-4 and CT vs. TT, P=0.76).

Less than 5% of all breast cancer cases are diagnosed before 40 years of age and less than 20% before 50 years of age. Treatments vary according to tumour stage and biological characteristics, age at diagnosis, menopausal status; co-morbidities are also important considerations in deciding what treatment to offer. Early age at breast cancer diagnosis is associated with a worse prognosis although the reasons for this are still imperfectly understood. Tumours in this age group are more likely to have adverse pathological features including a greater proportion of ER negative high grade tumours. Despite accounting for these factors, outcomes remain worse for young onset patients, particularly those with ER positive cancers and this may reflect a poorer response to breast cancer treatments in younger patients. A Swedish familial study demonstrated higher risk of mortality in affected first degree relatives of breast cancer patients which suggests a genetic component to prognosis following disease onset. A smaller gap in age at diagnosis between sister-sister pairs compared with mother-daughter pairs in this familial study coupled with poorer prognosis in sister-sister pairs suggests that earlier disease onset in sister-sister pairs could be linked with a greater genetic component for prognosis. Rare high penetrance genetic predisposition genes like BRCA1 are more frequently found to explain young onset breast cancer cases even in the absence of a family history. In addition it is becoming clear that the growing number of common genetic variants which contribute to polygenic breast cancer risk, are associated often more strongly with susceptibility to a particular sub-type of breast cancer.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 3486, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Common genetic variants may influence prognosis either by influencing the type of tumour that develops, the host response to tumour or the handling or metabolism of breast cancer directed therapies. Two recent studies developed from genome wide association experiments have failed to identify SNPs which are irrefutably associated with breast cancer prognosis in individuals of Caucasian ancestry. The median age at diagnosis in the patients recruited for these GWASs were 66 and 52 years hence these cohorts are largely comprised of later onset breast cancer patients. A more recent two stage GWAS in Chinese breast cancer patients identified two potential associations with breast cancer but the association effects in replication samples were much weaker than in the discovery set and would not satisfy stringent tests for multiple hypothesis correction.

To enrich the discovery set patients were selected from POSH in two different groups. The first group had ER, PR and HER-2 negative breast cancer (These triple negative patients have worse prognosis and they relapse early after diagnosis). This triple negative breast cancer group was also used to identify risk genes for Breast Cancer susceptibility in a previous study. In the second group we specifically enriched the selection for patients with either very short duration of breast cancer specific survival (<2 years, n=48) or relatively long duration of breast cancer specific survival (>4 years, n=125) but no selection based on immunohistochemistry was made in this group. Breast cancer specific survival was used as the definitive end-point for the survival analysis. Enrichment of affected individuals in a genetic association design increases the efficiency of and power to detect genetic effects. As all the study participants for this GWAs were derived from a single randomly sampled cohort of early onset patients, any overestimation of effect sizes in stage-1 was balanced out by meta-analysis with unenriched stage-2 samples. This approach is in keeping with a recent GWAS which identified five new breast cancer susceptibility loci by enriching cases by recruiting individuals with family history of breast cancer. There were no screen detected breast cancers amongst the POSH cases included in the discovery analysis, all had presented symptomatically. Amongst young onset breast cancer cases a higher than average proportion is likely to be BRCA1/2 gene carriers. Since BRCA1 and BRCA2 pathogenic germ-line mutations are not known to be independently associated with prognosis, BRCA status was not used in making the case selection for this study. The cohort has not yet been systematically tested for germ-line BRCA1/2 mutations but amongst the POSH study stage-1 participants, 27.4% (147 cases) had previously been analysed for BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations, either as part of other research studies or because testing had been clinically indicated (strong family history).

Despite having a more enriched stage-1 dataset, we did not have sufficient power (<80%) to detect association signals associated with HRs in range of 1.10 to 1.45 in our discovery samples. Future studies in larger early onset cohorts are therefore needed to identify true associations with lower effect sizes than HR>=1.50.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 23227, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The strongest association signal in our study was observed 596 kb upstream of the ARRDC3 gene. In HapMap we did not find any long range LD between rs421379 and any SNPs at or close to the ARRDC3 locus. The ARRDC3 gene is a member of the arrestin gene family and functions in a novel regulatory pathway that controls the cell surface adhesion molecule, b-4 integrin (ITGb4), a protein associated with aggressive tumour behaviour. Furthermore deletion of the region of chromosome 5 containing the ARRDC3 gene is observed more frequently in basal type breast cancer cancers. Differential expression levels have also been associated with prognosis in prostate cancer patients. The associated SNP rs421379 is located in the 5' region of the ARRDC3 gene and might affect a transcription binding site and ARRDC3 gene expression, permitting development of a more aggressive, invasive tumour. The associated SNP rs421379 was predicted to disrupt a binding site for Myocyte-specific enhancer factor 2 (MEF2). This transcription factor family consists of four members (MEF2A-D) sharing the binding sequence and MEF2 could regulate ARRDC3 gene expression. Previously, MEF2C has been found to be highly expressed in basal breast cancer along with Notch. Later a strong co-expression of Notch1 and MEF2 paralogs has been observed in breast cancer tumour samples from patients with metastatic disease.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 24616, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "We did not find a robust association signal between rs421379 and the probe representing variation in ARRDC3 expression (Figure 4).

It should be noted that the association analysis in Genevar 3.2.0 and scandb analysis is based on 154 twins and the 30 HapMap CEU trios respectively as such the statistical power to detect modest effects on gene expression was not high and further given that the gene expression is quantified in lymphoblastoid cell lines these results are not reflective of potential cis-effect of rs421379 in breast cancer related cells.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 25380, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The second strongest association we observed was at the PBX1 locus (HR=1.28 (1.16-1.43), p=3.8 x 10-6). The protein coded by this gene drives ERalpha signalling and breast cancer progression through transcriptional programming. There was no evidence of substantial heterogeneity in hazard ratios across stage-1 and stage-2 for the SNP associated at the PBX1 locus (Table 2). 11 SNPs according to HapMap Phase 3 data are in high LD (r2>0.8) with the PBX1 SNP we found as strongly associated and all these SNPs were found to be intronic within the PBX1 locus. We also observed strong suggestive evidence for an association at the RORalpha gene (HR=1.46 (1.24-1.72), p=3.9 x 10-6). It has recently been shown that RORalpha protein expression is reduced in breast cancer cells and also this lower expression is related to poorer prognosis in breast cancer patients. There was some evidence of heterogeneity in hazard ratios between stage-1 and stage-2 patients for the rs3884558 which lies 78.3 kb upstream of the RORalpha gene (p=0.04). Although there were no SNPs in high LD (r2>=0.8) 2.4 kb beyond rs3884558, SNPs in moderately LD (r2=0.3) are located up to 95.7 kb away from rs3884558 and close to the RORalpha gene. The SNP rs3884558 was predicted to both disrupt and create multiple transcription factor binding sites. The binding site was predicted to be lost for transcription factors POU2F1, TGIF1, HMGA1/2 and CDX2 and new binding site was predicted to emerge for REV-ERBalpha, CREB1/2, HMGA1, VBP1 and E4F1. Interestingly REV-ERBalpha belongs to the same nuclear hormone receptor family as does RORalpha. Moreover these family members are known to cross-talk and REV-ERBalpha has been shown to suppress the transcriptional activity of RORalpha.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 27132, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The two other associations at NTN1 and SYT6 could also be real given NTN1 expression is increased in breast cancer and the replication signal at SYT6 remained strong in post replication meta-analysis (HR=1.30 (1.16-1.47), p=7.9 x 10-6) with no strong evidence of heterogeneity in hazard ratios with the associated variant.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 27458, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Further studies at population level are needed to confirm the association of the 5 loci associated at p<=10-6 that we have discovered from this two stage GWAS analysis. In future analyses we will study the most strongly associated SNPs from the current study by interrogating additional well characterised and early onset breast cancer cohorts. This will allow us to generate more accurate estimates of gene-survival associations and also allow the implementation of prediction statistics generated using gene score analysis. In addition, further studies are needed to establish beyond doubt the true validity of the remaining SNPs that replicated strongly but were not quite genome wide significant. Published results from biochemical analyses do suggest PBX1, RORalpha and NTN1 are plausible candidate loci for an effect exerted by the host genotype in altering prognosis. Fine mapping and molecular studies are needed to establish the identity of the causal variant in the intragenic region, 596 kb upstream of ARRDC3 gene. and provide insight into the mechanism of action. Much emphasis currently is on genotyping of somatic mutations in tumours to help refine prognosis and identify treatment targets but this is only a part of the information that influences prognosis. Selecting a well characterised poor prognosis group of patients with high breast cancer specific mortality has been a useful strategy to identifying SNPs that influence prognosis. The ultimate validation of the clinical utility for germ-line genetic variants that influence prognosis will come from genotyping in randomised adjuvant and neo-adjuvant treatment trials. With a clear understanding of the magnitude and mechanism of prognostic SNPs, such genotyping may in future be routinely used in cancer patients to help derive a more complete individualised risk assessment for early relapse and thereby guide treatment choices.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 29364, "infons": {"section_type": "SUPPL", "type": "title_1"},
