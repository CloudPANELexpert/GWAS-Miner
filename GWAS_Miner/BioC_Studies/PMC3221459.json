Four CNVs that were not found in controls from the carcinoid GWAS were recurrent among cases, all of which occurred at a higher frequency in cases than in the additional 1512 population-based controls. CNVs can alter gene dosage and cause numerous chronic disorders, such as lupus, osteoporosis, and neuropsy-chiatric disorders including autism, schizophrenia, and mental retardation. Although constitutional CNVs have typically been associated with rare familial cancer syndromes (e.g. Von Hippel-Lindau disease, non-polyposis colorectal cancer), a ~120 kb deletion was recently shown to predispose children to neuroblastoma, serving as the first example of a non-syndromic cancer which is associated with constitutional CNVs.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 24856, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "A systematic review and meta-analysis determined that nearly 70% of ileal carcinoids show loss of chromosome 18q22-qter or all of chromosome 18. This provides strong evidence that loss of a tumor suppressor gene in this region is a critical step in the tumorigenesis of most ileal carcinoids. As this deletion was detected at equal frequencies in primary tumors as in metastatic tumors, which typically harbor a greater number of chromosomal aberrations, this provides substantial evidence that loss of chromosome 18 is an early event in carcinoid tumorigenesis, as opposed to one that is acquired during progression toward metastatic disease.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 25500, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "In our genome-wide analysis of CNVs, the CNV that was most enriched among cases was located at Chr18q22.1. Although this deletion is located in a gene-poor region of the chromosome, it is nonetheless an intriguing observation that deserves further attention. Although most CNVs are believed to arise as a result of non-allelic homologous recombination (NAHR), this deletion is not flanked by any regions with high sequence homology, making NAHR an unlikely explanation for the formation of this CNV. The center of the deleted region contains a palindromic AT-rich repeat, a structural element that can induce double-strand breaks and causes the most common known non-Robertsonian translocation. While non-homologous end-joining can repair such DNA damage, it is an imperfect process capable of creating small CNVs. Whether such a mechanism could be responsible for a deletion of 40 kb remains to be determined, but may underlie the genesis of this CNV.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 26453, "infons": {"fpage": "953", "lpage": "966", "name_0": "surname:Andersson;given-names:E", "name_1": "surname:Sward;given-names:C", "name_2": "surname:Stenman;given-names:G", "name_3": "surname:Ahlman;given-names:H", "name_4": "surname:Nilsson;given-names:O", "pub-id_doi": "10.1677/ERC-09-0052", "pub-id_pmid": "19458023", "section_type": "REF", "source": "Endocrine-Related Cancer", "type": "ref", "volume": "16", "year": "2009"}, "text": "High-resolution genomic profiling reveals gain of chromosome 14 as a predictor of poor outcome in ileal carcinoids", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 26568, "infons": {"fpage": "14", "lpage": "22", "name_0": "surname:Buchanan;given-names:KD", "name_1": "surname:Johnston;given-names:CF", "name_2": "surname:O'Hare;given-names:MM", "name_3": "surname:Ardill;given-names:JE", "name_4": "surname:Shaw;given-names:C", "name_5": "surname:Collins;given-names:JS", "name_6": "surname:Watson;given-names:RG", "name_7": "surname:Atkinson;given-names:AB", "name_8": "surname:Hadden;given-names:DR", "name_9": "surname:Kennedy;given-names:TL", "pub-id_doi": "10.1016/0002-9343(86)90581-4", "pub-id_pmid": "2879446", "section_type": "REF", "source": "American Journal of Medicine", "type": "ref", "volume": "81", "year": "1986"}, "text": "Neuroendocrine tumors.
