In contrast, TS had a smaller, non-significant polygenic component, predicting only 0.6% of the phenotypic variance (p=0.06).

The TS discovery sample was also too small to examine polygenic signals in TS subgroups (TS+OCD vs. TS-OCD); thus, it is possible that the TS polygenic signal could increase if \"TS only\" discovery and target samples were available.
