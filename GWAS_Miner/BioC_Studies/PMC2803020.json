However, both variants were associated with reduced levels of CRP, suggesting that the links with CHD are not mediated by CRP. LEPR has not previously been reported to increase risk of CHD, though associations of variants in the APOE-CI-CII cluster with CHD have been observed. While the association of genetic variation in APOE-CI-CII with CHD can be explained in large part by its effects on blood lipids, this is not the case for SNP rs6700896 in LEPR, which was not associated with major CHD risk factors. SNP rs6700896 is located in intron 19 of LEPR, the gene encoding the leptin receptor, a member of the class I cytokine receptor family. LEPR is expressed in the hypothalamus and vascular endothelial cells, and LEPR signalling has a role in appetite control, weight regulation, glucose homeostasis, blood pressure regulation and angiogenesis.

Because of the relatively small effect of common genetic variants in CRP locus on CRP levels, large sample size is needed to detect associations with CHD. In order to combine data across studies in our Mendelian randomisation study, we assumed a common effect on risk of CHD from different variants in the CRP locus, by standardising to a common difference on the log CRP scale. This approach is valid to the extent that the hypothesised effect of CRP variants on CHD risk reflects circulating levels of CRP. Though we found no association of CRP variants with CHD risk, it is not possible to exclude a small effect, despite the large sample size. However, we can effectively exclude the size of association predicted from observational data on the relationship of CRP levels to CHD.
