We found a unique genome-wide significant gene region - SH3BP5-NR2C2 - that was enriched with 11 replicable risk SNPs for alcohol and nicotine co-dependence.

All replicable risk markers available for eQTL analysis had nominal cis- and trans-acting regulatory effects on gene expression. The transcript expression of the genes in this region was regulated partly by several nicotine dependence-related genes and significantly correlated with transcript expression of many alcohol and nicotine dependence-related genes.

Apparently, Bonferroni correction (alpha=5x10-8) is overly conservative because it treats all of the one million markers in the genome as independent (which is impossible). Alternatively, a WTCCC-defined alpha (=5x10-7) might be more appropriate to the present study. As a complementary approach, we also corrected the findings in screening stage by genome-wide false discovery rate (FDR), replicated the findings, and confirmed them by functional studies. Only when a region containing at least one association in meta-analysis that survived WTCCC-defined genome-wide correction (p<5x10-7) together with FDR<0.05, and was replicable across EAs, AAs, and meta-analysis and confirmed by functional studies, should it be taken as a \"significant\" region, which was conservative enough for statistical significance. In the testing step, (1) two independent samples were used to replicate each other, which significantly reduced the chance of false positive findings (i.e., false discovery rate). (2) We aimed to detect replicable regions, not individual markers. Thus, more than one risk marker were detected in the risk regions, which reduced the chance of false positive associations too. (3) Functional analysis in distinct tissues as confirmation of association finding further reduced the chance of false positive findings (including co-localization of association signals and eQTL signals randomly), although using different independent samples in one study might increase the false negative rates due to sample heterogeneity. (4) -log(P) value distributions across EAs, AAs and meta-analysis were compared using Pearson correlation analysis. The consistency between them would significantly reduce the chance of false positive findings. Therefore, in the testing step, when an association was replicable across EAs, AAs and meta-analysis, alpha could be set at 0.05 (except for the exon-level cis-eQTL findings that needed to be corrected for the number of exons and the types of tissues).

The first causal locus might be rs9868848 in ZFYVE20 in block 1 that is a non-synonymous variant (Leu591Pro) located in a coding region. It could significantly alter the RNA secondary structure. It was functional in brain and PBMC with nominal cis- and trans-acting regulatory effects (Table 1). Its minor allele protected against risk for alcohol and nicotine co-dependence. Two other SNPs (rs28445844 in NR2C2 and rs2306853 in ZFYVE20) in LD with this SNP could also slightly alter the RNA secondary structures, and rs2306853 is located in an exonic splicing silencer or enhancer (Table S2). Alternatively, SH3BP5-CAPN7 (block 2) might possibly harbor a second putative causal locus, because the most significant SNP in this region was rs1318937 in SH3BP5 and this SNP could also slightly alter the RNA secondary structures (Table S2). Its minor allele increased risk for alcohol and nicotine co-dependence. However, all risk markers in this region were predicted to most likely lack any phenotypic effect (by Polyphen-2; Table S2), so that the causal loci might not be any one of these risk markers. It is warranted in future studies to identify the causal loci by sequencing the whole SH3BP5-NR2C2 region.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 24145, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "In the present study, although we studied alcohol and nicotine co-dependence, we obtained results that were similar to a previous GWAS that examined alcohol dependence using SAGE data.
