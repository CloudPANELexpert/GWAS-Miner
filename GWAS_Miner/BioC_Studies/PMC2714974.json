Known susceptibility genes account for less than 25% of the familial risk of breast cancer, and the residual genetic variance is likely to be due to variants conferring more moderate risks. To identify further susceptibility alleles, we conducted a two-stage genome-wide association study in 4,398 breast cancer cases and 4,316 controls, followed by a third stage in which 30 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were tested for confirmation in 21,860 cases and 22,578 controls from 22 studies. We used 227,876 SNPs that were estimated to correlate with 77% of known common SNPs in Europeans at r2>0.5.

In the 1990s, two major susceptibility genes for breast cancer, BRCA1 and BRCA2, were identified. Inherited mutations in these genes lead to a high risk of breast and other cancers. However, the majority of multiple case breast cancer families do not segregate mutations in these genes. Subsequent genetic linkage studies have failed to identify further major breast cancer genes. These observations have led to the proposal that breast cancer susceptibility is largely 'polygenic': that is, susceptibility is conferred by a large number of loci, each with a small effect on breast cancer risk. This model is consistent with the observed patterns of familial aggregation of breast cancer. However, progress in identifying the relevant loci has been slow. As linkage studies lack power to detect alleles with moderate effects on risk, large case-control association studies are required. Such studies have identified variants in the DNA repair genes CHEK2, ATM, BRIP1 and PALB2 that confer an approximately twofold risk of breast cancer, but these variants are rare in the population. A recent study has shown that a common coding variant in CASP8 is associated with a moderate reduction in breast cancer risk. After accounting for all the known breast cancer loci, more than 75% of the familial risk of the disease remains unexplained.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 2778, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Recent technological advances have provided platforms that allow hundreds of thousands of SNPs to be analysed in association studies, thus providing a basis for identifying moderate risk alleles without prior knowledge of position or function. It has been estimated that there are 7 million common SNPs in the human genome (with minor allele frequency, m.a.f., >5%). However, because recombination tends to occur at distinct 'hot-spots', neighbouring polymorphisms are often strongly correlated (in 'linkage disequilibrium', LD) with each other. The majority of common genetic variants can therefore be evaluated for association using a few hundred thousand SNPs as tags for all the other variants. We aimed to identify further breast cancer susceptibility loci in a three-stage association study. In the first stage, we used a panel of 266,722 SNPs, selected to tag known common variants across the entire genome. These SNPs were genotyped in 408 breast cancer cases and 400 controls from the UK; data were analysed for 390 cases and 364 controls genotyped for >=80% of the SNPs. The cases were selected to have a strong family history of breast cancer, equivalent to at least two affected female first-degree relatives, because such cases are more likely to carry susceptibility alleles. Initally, we analysed 227,876 SNPs (85%) with genotypes on at least 80% of the subjects. We estimate that these SNPs are correlated with 58% of common SNPs in the HapMap CEPH/CEU (Utah residents with ancestry from northern and western Europe) samples at r2>0.8, and 77% at r2>0.5 (mean r2=0.75; see Supplementary Fig. 1) (http://www.hapmap.org/). As expected, coverage was strongly related to m.a.f.: 70% of SNPs with m.a.f.>10% were tagged at r2>0.8, compared with 23% of SNPs with m.a.f. 5-10%. The main analyses were restricted to 205,586 SNPs that had a call rate of 90% and whose genotype distributions did not differ from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in controls (at P<10-5).", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 4763, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "For the second stage we selected 12,711 SNPs, approximately 5% of those typed in stage 1, on the basis of the significance of the difference in genotype frequency between cases and controls.

Possible explanations for this inflation include population stratification, cryptic relatedness among subjects, and differential genotype calling between cases and controls. There was evidence for an excess of low call rate SNPs among the most significant SNPs (P<0.01) in stage 1, but not in stage 2, suggesting that some of this effect is a genotyping artefact (Supplementary Table 1). However, the inflation was still present among SNPs with call rate >99% in both cases and controls, possibly reflecting population sub-structure. We computed 1 degree of freedom (d.f.) association tests for each SNP, combining stages 1 and 2. After adjustment for this inflation by the genomic control method, we observed more associations than would have been expected by chance at P<0.05 (Table 1).

Six SNPs showed associations in stage 3 that were significant at P<=10-5 with effects in the same direction as in stages 1 and 2 (Table 2, Supplementary Table 3, and Fig. 2). All these SNPs reached a combined significance level of P<10-7 (ranging from 2x10-76 to 3x10-9). Of these six SNPs, five were within genes or LD blocks containing genes. SNP rs2981582 lies in intron 2 of FGFR2 (also known as CEK3), which encodes the fibroblast growth factor receptor 2. SNPs rs12443621 and rs8051542 are both located in an LD block containing the 5' end of TNRC9 (also known as TOX3), a gene of uncertain function containing a tri-nucleotide repeat motif, as well as the hypothetical gene, LOC643714. SNP rs889312 lies in an LD block of approximately 280 kb that contains MAP3K1 (also known as MEKK), which encodes the signalling protein mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase 1, in addition to two other genes: MGC33648 and MIER3. SNP rs3817198 lies in intron 10 of LSP1 (also known as WP43), encoding lymphocyte-specific protein 1, an F-actin bundling cytoskeletal protein expressed in haematopoietic and endothelial cells. A further SNP, rs2107425, located just 110 kilobases (kb) from rs3817198, was also identified (overall P=0.00002). rs2107425 is within the H19 gene, an imprinted maternally expressed untranslated messenger RNA closely involved in regulation of the insulin growth factor gene, IGF2. In stage 3, however, rs2107425 was only weakly significant after adjustment for rs3817198 by logistic regression (P=0.06). This suggests that the association with breast cancer risk may be driven by variants in LSP1 rather than in H19. The sixth SNP reaching a combined P<10-7 was rs13281615, which lies on 8q. It is correlated with SNPs in a 110 kb LD block that contains no known genes. The basis of this association therefore remains obscure.

The additional tag SNPs were genotyped in the SEARCH study cases and controls. Multiple logistic regression analysis of these variants found no additional evidence for association after adjusting for rs2981582. Haplotype analysis of these 7 SNPs indicated that multiple haplotypes carrying the minor (a) allele of rs2981582 were associated with an increased risk of breast cancer, implying that the association was being driven by rs2981582 itself or a variant strongly correlated with it (Supplementary Table 4).", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 10391, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Resequencing of this region in 45 subjects of European origin identified 29 variants that were strongly correlated with rs2981582 (r2>0.6) (http://cgwb.nci.nih.gov; Fig. 3b and Supplementary Tables 5-8). A subset of 14 variants tagged 27 of these in European (r2>0.95) and Asian (Korean) samples (r2>0.86). Two variants could not be genotyped reliably.

Diamonds represent the summary odds ratios, with 95% confidence intervals, based on the stage 3 studies only.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 46011, "infons": {"file": "ukmss-5232-f0003.jpg", "id": "F3", "section_type": "FIG", "type": "fig_title_caption"}, "text": "The FGFR2 locus", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 46027, "infons": {"file": "ukmss-5232-f0003.jpg", "id": "F3", "section_type": "FIG", "type": "fig_caption"}, "text": "a, Map of the whole FGFR2 gene, viewed relative to common SNPs on HapMap. The gene is 126 kb long and in reverse 3'-5' orientation on chromosome 10. Exon positions are illustrated with respect to the 67 SNPs with m.a.f.>5% in HapMap CEU (therefore the map is not to physical scale). Numbered SNPs are those tested in the genomewide study. SNPs in black were not significant in stage 1. Those in red were significant at P<0.0001 after stage 2. rs10510097 (orange) was significant in stage 1, but failed quality control in stage 2 owing to deviation from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Squares indicate pairwise r2 on a greyscale (black=1, white=0). Red circle indicates rs2981582. b, Resequenced 32 kb region, shown relative to SNPs in CEU with m.a.f.>5%, showing pairwise LD for SNPs in HapMap CEU (left panel) and JPT/CHB (right panel).

Red circle indicates rs2981582. SNPs in grey are those used in the initial tagging of known common HapMap SNPs within the block. SNPs in black are correlated with rs2981582 with r2>0.6 in European samples.
