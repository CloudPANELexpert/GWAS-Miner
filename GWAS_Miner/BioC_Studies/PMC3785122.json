Variation in personality is predictive of many outcomes in life, including mental health. Here we report on a meta-analysis of genome-wide association (GWA) data for personality in ten discovery samples (17 375 adults) and five in-silico replication samples (3 294 adults). All participants were of European ancestry. Personality scores for Neuroticism, Extraversion, Openness to Experience, Agreeableness, and Conscientiousness were based on the NEO Five-Factor Inventory. Genotype data were available of ~2.4M Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs; directly typed and imputed using HAPMAP data). In the discovery samples, classical association analyses were performed under an additive model followed by meta-analysis using the weighted inverse variance method. Results showed genome-wide significance for Openness to Experience near the RASA1 gene on 5q14.3 (rs1477268 and rs2032794, P = 2.8 x 10-8 and 3.1 x 10-8) and for Conscientiousness in the brain-expressed KATNAL2 gene on 18q21.1 (rs2576037, P = 4.9 x 10-8). We further conducted a gene-based test that confirmed the association of KATNAL2 to Conscientiousness. In-silico replication did not, however, show significant associations of the top SNPs with Openness and Conscientiousness, although the direction of effect of the KATNAL2 SNP on Conscientiousness was consistent in all replication samples.

Over the last century, scientific consensus has converged on a taxonomic model of personality traits based on five higher-order dimensions of Neuroticism, Extraversion, Openness to Experience, Agreeableness and Conscientiousness, known as the Five-Factor Model (FFM). These five dimensions are largely independent and provide a broad description of personality. Neuroticism is commonly defined as emotional instability; it involves the experience of negative emotions such as anxiety, depression, hostility, and the vulnerability to stress. Extraversion is characterized by positive emotions, gregariousness, and the tendency to be active, seek out stimulation and enjoy the company of others. Openness to Experience involves active imagination, aesthetic attentiveness, variety preference and intellectual curiosity. Agreeableness can be defined as the tendency to be cooperative and compassionate rather than suspicious and antagonistic towards others. Lastly, the dimension of Conscientiousness reflects self-discipline, carefulness, thoroughness, organization, deliberation and achievement.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 2926, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Personality traits predict a host of social, behavioral and health outcomes, such as job performance, longevity, and many psychiatric disorders, including substance abuse and dependency, mood disorders such as major depressive disorder (MDD), anxiety disorders, and personality disorders. For example, Neuroticism reflects a liability trait for MDD and other mood and anxiety disorders and also explains part of the comorbidity among these disorders. MDD is also predicted by low Conscientiousness. With regard to substance (ab)use, tobacco smokers score high on Neuroticism and low on Conscientiousness. A similar but more extreme pattern is seen for cocaine and heroin users; in contrast, marijuana users score high on Openness to Experience and low on Agreeableness and Conscientiousness. The FFM dimensions further predict tendencies toward different types of personality disorder, with high scores on Neuroticism and low scores on Agreeableness predicting many of the personality disorders and with low or high scores on Extraversion predicting different disorders. Personality is also predictive of beneficial outcomes.
