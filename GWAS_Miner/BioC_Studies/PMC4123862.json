In contrast, a case-control study of CHD in Chinese subjects revealed the CC variant of rs174547 was associated with higher HDL-C and triglyceride levels. The investigators proposed that these variations in lipid levels may be partially attributable to the FADS variant which may contribute to CHD development. Finally, a candidate gene case-control study of coronary artery disease reported that certain FADS haplotypes were associated with disease risk. Contrary to these studies, null findings have also been reported in the cohorts of the Nurses' Health Study (n=1200) and the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study (n=1295). It remains important to identify the relationship(s) between SNPs and lipid traits which improve our biological understanding of these pathways. Further, studies are needed to investigate the association of the new genes with the intermediate endpoints, such as leukotrienes, thromboxanes, and lipoxins, and with disease outcomes.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 22809, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The current study highlights the unique strength of non-hypothesis-driven GWAS for identifying novel common genetic polymorphisms associated with n6 PUFAs. Using samples with European ancestry from each cohort, as well as including factors for population stratification using principal components analysis, reduces the potential for confounding by population stratification. The meta-analysis approach combines results from multiple cohorts to increase the statistical power to identify genes that may not have been identified due to small effects or low frequency. Importantly, our meta-analysis results were consistent across all participating cohorts [Supplementary Figure 1], further increasing confidence in the validity and generalizability of the findings.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 23573, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Potential limitations may be considered. First, InCHIANTI examined total plasma fatty acid composition, while the other cohorts examined the composition of phospholipid fatty acid fraction. Yet, findings from InCHIANTI were similar to those observed in the other cohorts. Both the magnitude and direction of associations were consistent across all 5 cohorts (Supplementary Figure 1). We also carried out meta-analysis excluding the InCHIANTI study. Notably, the observed associations on chromosome 10, 11, and 16 were weaker but still consistent (data not shown) which suggests that the tissue where fatty acids were measured had minimal effects on the identified SNP-fatty acid associations. Second, it is possible that environmental factors may influence the gene-fatty acid associations. However, the fatty acid-SNP associations changed little when including BMI, physical activity and dietary linoleic acid and energy intakes in the statistical models using ARIC data (Supplementary Table 9). Third, it must be acknowledged that the present analysis is a hypothesis generating study. And although we have speculated on potential mechanisms, further research is required to elucidate the biological effects of the identified polymorphisms. In addition, due to the high LD in identified loci, it is unclear which SNPs are causal with the associated FA, and finer mapping of these regions is needed to identify the functional SNP. Lastly, although our findings passed stringent thresholds for multiple testing corrections, future replication studies are still needed to confirm our results in other European populations as well other cohorts of different racial groups.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 25244, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Our study confirmed previous GWAS findings that FADS gene variants are associated with plasma and cell membrane fatty acid composition for n6 fatty acids.
