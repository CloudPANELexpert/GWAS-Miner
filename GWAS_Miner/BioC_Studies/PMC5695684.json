Reproductive tempo (AFB) and quantum (NEB) are cross-cutting topics in the medical, biological, evolutionary and social sciences and central in national and international policies. Advanced societies experienced a rapid postponement of AFB, with the mean AFB of women now being 28-29 years in many countries. This increase in AFB has been linked to lower fertility rates, unprecedented childlessness (~20%) and infertility, which affects 10 to 15 % of couples. An estimated 48.5 million couples worldwide are infertile, with a large part of subfertility, particularly in men, remaining unexplained.

AFB and NEB represent accurate measures of complex reproductive outcomes, are frequently recorded and consistently measured, and are key parameters for demographic population forecasting. There is evidence of a genetic component underlying reproduction, with heritability estimates of up to 50% for AFB and NEB (Supplementary Figure 1). A recent study attributed 15% of the variance of AFB and 10% of NEB to common genetic variants. There are also sex-specific differences in human reproduction, related to the timing of fertility, fecundability and sex-genotype interactions (Supplementary Note). Researchers have given less attention to traits such as NEB due to an erroneous and frequently repeated misinterpretation of Fisher's Fundamental Theorem of Natural Selection that the additive genetic variance in fitness should be close to zero. The misreading had a naively intuitive appeal: genes that reduce fitness should have been less frequently passed on. Fisher, however, actually argues that fitness is moderately heritable in human populations (for a discussion see the Supplementary Note).

Secondly, rs2777888 - or functional variants in LD with it - may influence the cell cycle by altering the expression of RBM5 and RBM6 (RNA binding motif proteins 5 and 6).

LAMP2 is expressed at the protein level in male and female reproductive organs with an effect size of rs2777888 for LAMP2 mRNA expression that is almost twice as large in women than in men (Supplementary Figure 4).

We merged the SNPs from this meta-analysis with the publically available association results of the most recent GWAS on age at menarche2 and age at menopause from the Reprogen consortium website.1 SNPs that were not present in both files were dropped from the analysis. We aligned the alleles and the direction of effects using the EasyStrata software. We then selected the independent SNPs with a P-value<1x10-05, using the clump procedure in PLINK, (1000Kb window and LD threshold of R2>0.1) to identify the most significant SNPs in associated regions included in both files. We defined \"prioritized SNP associations\" as those that passed the Bonferroni correction for the number of SNPs tested (0.05/122=4.10x10-04, both in age at menarche and age at menopause). Our results identified three SNPs after Bonferroni-correction that can be used as good candidates for age at menarche.

These coordinates were used to extract all genes located within +-40kb of lead SNPs using the UCSC table browser. The identified genes then served as input for ToppGene and Endeavour. Genes with established roles in fertility served as training genes in this procedure, i.e. BRCA1, EGFR, ERBB2-4, HSD17B1, RBM5, ESR1, ESR2 and FSHB. For MetaRanker we provided SNPs that reached P<5x10-04 and their chromosomal position as input, together with the previously mentioned set of training genes. Since ToppGene, Endeavour and MetaRanker are biased towards larger and well-described genes, we also performed a gene prioritization procedure using DEPICT.

First, we estimated how the coefficients change if we control for Educational Attainment (EA). Using data from deCODE, we ran an additional association analysis using the 10 loci that were genome-wide significant in the meta-analysis (P<5x10-08). The analysis has been restricted to individuals born between 1910 and 1975, who also had data available on completed education. The total sample size is 42,187 (17,996 males and 24,191 females). The analysis is adjusted for sex, year of birth (linear, squared and cubic), interaction between sex and year of birth and the first 10 PCAs. Education is measured by years of education, ranging between 10 and 20 years. Supplementary Table 40 reports the association results before and after adjusting for educational attainment. Our analysis shows that the effect sizes shrink after including educational attainment as a covariate, with an average reduction of around 15%. We also estimated the effect of a polygenic risk score of AFB calculated from meta-analysis data excluding the deCODE cohort. The polygenic score remains highly significant. The effect of 1SD of the AFB score decreases from 0.19 years (69 days) without controlling for education to 0.16 years (59 days) when we control for years of education. Second, we estimated how the coefficients change after controlling for Education Attainment (EA) and Age at First Sex using the UKBiobank (N=50,954). We ran two association models: the first follows the GWAS analysis plan with no additional covariates and the second added years of education and age at first sexual intercourse as covariates. The results are presented in Supplementary Table 41 and Supplementary Figure 37. Our analysis shows that the effect sizes of our top hits are highly concordant (R2=0.94). The inclusion of EA and AFS as covariates weakens the effect sizes on average by 40% and increases the P-value of the estimated coefficients.
