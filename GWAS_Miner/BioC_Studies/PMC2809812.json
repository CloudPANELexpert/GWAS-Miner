As with many major technical advances, these results have raised additional questions. To date, there have been few type 2 diabetes GWAS in U.S. minority populations. In addition, evaluations of consensus type 2 diabetes associated SNPs from European-derived studies suggest the influence of these polymorphisms in U.S. minorities, especially African Americans, may be limited. A feature of these GWAS has been that most of the type 2 diabetes genes identified likely mediate their influence on type 2 diabetes susceptibility through the beta-cell. This contrasts with the widely accepted belief that insulin resistance is a major component of type 2 diabetes susceptibility(e.g.). One possibility is that GWAS evaluation of type 2 diabetes cases compared with non-diabetic controls may not be an efficient method to locate genes which code for other risk factors for type 2 diabetes, e.g. reduced insulin action, and/or inability of the beta-cells to compensate for insulin resistance, i.e. disposition index.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 2897, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The purpose of this study was to evaluate two quantitative, directly assessed measures of insulin resistance (SI and DI) in a non-European population.

The initial genotyping was performed in 229 subjects from the IRAS-FS San Antonio, TX, population as a rapid and cost effective method for scanning the genome. To our knowledge this is the first report of a GWAS of direct measures of glucose homeostasis, SI and DI. Insulin resistance is an important component of type 2 diabetes risk and an independent risk factor for complications such as atherosclerosis. DI is a strong predictor of conversion to type 2 diabetes, and thus a phenotype of potentially crucial importance in understanding the genetic underpinnings of type 2 diabetes. While DI has frequently been interpreted as a beta-cell functional response to insulin resistance, this phenotype may also capture more central or other tissue effects which regulate glucose homeostasis. The signaling mechanism involved in beta-cell compensation is still not clearly delineated, leaving the possibility that extrapancreatic factors are changed in those at risk for type 2 diabetes. Such putative signals related to DI-associated loci without a clear link to SI or AIRg, may be of greatest interest for follow-up since they could identify central regulatory pathways of glucose homeostasis.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 18062, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Genes identified by GWAS from study designs comparing allele frequencies between type 2 diabetes-affected subjects and non-type 2 diabetes controls appear primarily, if not solely, beta-cell genes. While these observations can be interpreted as a lack of insulin-resistance risk variants, several lines of evidence suggest that GWAS designed around contrasting type 2 diabetes/non-type 2 diabetes subjects may not be optimal for identifying genes influencing insulin sensitivity. Insulin resistance is common in adults. For example, 45-55% of the non-diabetic European-American, Hispanic-American, and African-American participants in IRAS have SI values <1.0 (data not shown). Thus, as many as half of these non-diabetic, middle aged adults are significantly insulin resistant, yet few of the prior type 2 diabetes GWAS have detailed, high quality measures of insulin sensitivity to identify insulin resistance in their control subjects. As an alternative approach, the use of surrogate measures of insulin resistance, e.g. fasting insulin or homeostatic model assessment (HOMAIR), provides some improvement, but in IRAS, Spearman correlations of fasting insulin and SI was -0.61 and HOMAIR and SI was -0.68 among those with normal glucose tolerance. For Hispanic Americans in the IRAS-FS, Spearman correlation of HOMAIR and SI was -0.71, and HOMAIR and DI was -0.46 (data not shown). Importantly, these surrogates correlate especially poorly in subjects with glucose intolerance/insulin resistance with Spearman correlation of HOMAIR and SI of -0.39 and HOMAIR and DI of -0.34 for Hispanic-American subjects with SI<1.0 and fasting insulin and SI of -0.40 and -0.34 in persons with impaired glucose tolerance and type 2 diabetes, respectively, in the IRAS-FS (data not shown). In addition, minimal model-based assessment of insulin sensitivity (SI) has been shown to have greater heritability and a different genetic basis than HOMAIR or fasting insulin. It is important to note that minimal model based measurement of SI is a direct measure of insulin sensitivity rather than a surrogate and reflects dynamic measurements of insulin sensitivity compared to HOMAIR which is basal state measurement.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 20279, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "To carry out this study we chose a research design in which a 317K SNP GWAS was performed on 229 Hispanic-American subjects from one clinical center (San Antonio, TX). From the analysis, a set of 1536 high scoring SNPs were chosen for validation in the IRAS-FS Hispanic-American sample in which we have high quality metabolic measures. While we ideally would have carried out a GWAS of the entire sample set, it should be noted that numerous important genes have been identified from GWAS analysis of small initial samples. Examples are the complement factor H gene and macular degeneration (; 224cases/134 controls), NOS1AP gene and cardiac repolarization(; 200 subjects), TNFSF15 and Crohn's disease(; 94 subjects) and CDKN2A/B genes with coronary heart disease (; 322 cases/312 controls). While one would expect a high level of noise from the GWAS, it is encouraging to note that 10 of the final top 16 SNPs for SI and 10 of the final top 13 SNPs for DI from the 1536 SNP analysis scored high for these traits in the GWAS stage analysis. Clearly this approach is not perfect though: the highest scoring DI SNP, rs2540970 in SLC1A4, was not associated with DI in the GWAS (P=0.47). This result could have been excluded from further consideration, but it is noteworthy that methodological studies by Skol et al. have suggested that an approach using joint analysis of data is more efficient than replication-based analysis for two-stage GWAS. In follow-up genotyping, two additional SNPs in SLC1A4, rs2075209 and rs6546119, also showed evidence of association with DI (P<0.0043) suggesting SLC1A4 may be associated with DI. With these provisos, we emphasize that the evidence for association does not meet genome-wide significance, and we consider the loci reported here as candidates for future detailed evaluation rather than confirmed SI and DI genes. Relevant to this issue we have generated quantile-quantile (Q-Q) plots (Figure 1) from the GWAS analysis. These plots compare the observed versus expected values of the Z test statistics under the null hypothesis of no association across the genome. As expected, the majority of SNPs exhibit a -log10(P-value) <2.

Although IRAS-FS has limited power to detect association with type 2 diabetes with 181 type 2 diabetes -affected Hispanic participants, SNPs rs6794189 in MAGI1 and rs10793057 near P2RY2 have evidence of association with type 2 diabetes in discrete trait analysis with P-values of 0.0099 and 0.0016, respectively (data not shown), lending additional support for their relevance.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 23804, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Gene families are represented in the overall results of the GWAS analysis: MAGI2, in the same family as MAGI1, is nominally associated with DI (data not shown) and several other traits in the study (Haritunians et al., in preparation). SNP rs321983 in MAGI2 is nominally associated with type 2 diabetes (P=0.0072) in the Starr County, TX, Mexican American 100K type 2 diabetes GWAS. The only other SNP which overlapped with previous type 2 diabetes GWAS was rs10504553 in TCEB1, the 11th ranked SNP for SI and 14th for DI in our study, ranked 20th in the Amish type 2 diabetes 100K GWAS. We have reviewed in detail the available results from other type 2 diabetes GWAS (e.g., Diabetes Genetics Initiative, Finland United States Investigation of NIDDM Genetics, and Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium) and subsequent meta-analyses including supplementary material to identify type 2 diabetes associated SNPs that overlap with our study. No overlap was observed with either the individual studies or meta-analysis results.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 24829, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "In spite of the numerous advantages of performing GWAS studies in the IRAS-FS sample, there are limitations. First, there are very few comparable studies with minimal-model assessed SI and DI, especially in Hispanic-American samples. Minimal model assessment of glucose homeostasis measures in diabetics has limitations, so it should be noted that IRAS-FS subjects with a type 2 diabetes diagnosis were excluded from these analyses. The admixture-adjusted, additive P-values that we report do not meet genome-wide significance. SI and DI in our Hispanic families are moderately heritable: SI ranging from 0.29 to 0.38 and DI ranging from 0.20-0.37. The effect sizes reflected in the genotypic means for each SNP as summarized in Supplementary Table 5 are in a range, 8 to 41% of a standard deviation that are consistent with power estimates for this study design. Quantitative measures of glucose homeostasis have greater power on a per individual basis than discrete traits. Under an additive model, MAF=0.15, and alpha=0.0001 we have estimated power of 0.90 of detecting a 0.30 standard deviation change in the genotypic means. In summary, using a GWAS approach we have identified several genic and non-genic loci that are candidates for association with insulin sensitivity index and disposition index in a sample of Hispanic-American families. More compelling evidence of association with SI and DI will require additional replication samples. In addition, with the study design that we have used (317K SNPs in 229 subjects), the genome has not been covered in detail and other loci influencing SI and DI likely remain to be identified.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 26470, "infons": {"section_type": "SUPPL", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "Supplementary Material", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 26493, "infons": {"section_type": "FIG", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "Figure and Tables", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 26511, "infons": {"file": "nihms158862f1.jpg", "id": "F1", "section_type": "FIG", "type": "fig_caption"}, "text": "Quantile-quantile plots for the initial GWAS analysis (n=229).
