Previous work to pinpoint HLA alleles that could be responsible for the signal in the MHC have had varied success. Comparison of association with HLA alleles across studies is complicated by differences in the methodology used to call alleles, as well as differences in the populations being studied. In this study, the strongest HLA allele association was found with HLA-C*01:02, and this was separate from the top SNP signal.

Two of these loci were identified from imputation based on reference panels from the 1000 Genomes data, suggesting the inclusion of the imputation data was a useful addition to this study.
