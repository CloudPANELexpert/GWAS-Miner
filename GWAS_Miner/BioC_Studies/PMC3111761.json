Two large, randomized trials recently published interim results on PSA screening in relation to prostate cancer-specific mortality. While their main findings were divergent, both studies concluded that screening was associated with substantially increased risks of over-diagnosis and over-treatment. Therefore the ability to target screening to men at higher risk for more aggressive disease may allow for early detection of those at higher risk for developing clinically significant prostate cancer. It may also reduce the number of men at low risk for clinically significant disease whose quality of life and function (e.g., urinary, sexual) may be impacted by intensive treatment that may be unnecessary.

One reason for this could be the inclusion of Gleason score 7 disease in the criteria for defining aggressiveness. Gleason 7 tumors are a heterogeneous group that are less aggressive than Gleason score 8-10 tumors, which may have attenuated associations with aggressiveness. Therefore, defining aggressive disease using stricter phenotype criteria (e.g., Gleason scor e 8-10, regional/distant stage) may reduce heterogeneity and strengthen results. Lack of statistical power due to limited sample size is also an issue in these studies, especially to detect less common variants or those with weak to modest effects. As the proportion of cases meeting a stricter aggressive disease definition will be small in most studies (e.g., 15-30% of all cases), collaborative efforts will be needed to obtain enough samples to achieve sufficient power.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 14489, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "In the study presented here, we found evidence that SNP rs6497287 is more strongly associated with more aggressive than with less aggressive disease. It must be noted though that a significant difference in risk estimates between the two phenotypes was not observed. Whether this is due to the limited sample size or the fact that this SNP is actually associated with overall disease risk will have to be determined in larger studies. Nonetheless, this variant highlights an interesting prostate cancer candidate gene. SNP rs6497287 is located in HERC2, a large 93 exon gene on 15q11-13. This gene functions as a determinant of human iris color and has recently been shown to have a role in the DNA damage response. HERC2 protein both mediates the specificity of E3 ubiquitin ligase binding and acts as an E3 ligase itself, regulating XPA and BRCA1 protein levels. It is interesting to note that HERC2 translocates from the cytoplasm to the nucleus to participate in the above-described functions and the rs6497287 variant is located close to the nuclear localization signal of HERC2.

Significant strengths include the focus on aggressive prostate cancer and the population-based resource for confirmation. The genetic heterogeneity of prostate cancer is well known, therefore to reduce heterogeneity and increase the likelihood of identifying aggressive prostate cancer risk variants, cases with clinical features associated with adverse outcomes were chosen for the GWAS. Results from this phase were then validated in a dataset comprising a more widely used definition of aggressive disease, including all cases with a Gleason score >=7 tumor. This definition was used by CGEMS and although Gleason score 7 tumors are heterogeneous and there are differences between the CGEMS study and the one presented here, CGEMS is the only publicly available GWAS dataset that allows assessment of risk for more aggressive prostate cancer to which our findings can be compared. Another advantage of this study is that over 380,000 SNPs were examined compared to the previous study by Xu and colleagues in which only ~27,000 SNPs were examined for associations with aggressive disease. A major limitation of this GWAS is the small sample size due to funding constraints. It should be noted that the small proportion of samples in the GWAS stage and the small proportion of SNPs carried through to the independent replication stage of this study, provided comparable power as would be obtained from jointly analyzing the data from both stages.

This finding lends strength to the hypothesis that there is a genetic susceptibility to clinically significant prostate cancer. As is the prediction for indolent prostate cancer, many low- to moderate-penetrant common risk alleles may contribute to the inherited predisposition for more aggressive disease. Therefore, due to the relatively small proportion of patients with aggressive versus indolent disease in most prostate cancer study populations, future collaborative efforts will be needed to attain genome-wide statistical power for finding genetic variants that uniquely distinguish men at higher risk for the more aggressive disease phenotype. Once this goal is realized, genetic variants may be useful for stratification of men who may benefit most from early detection and screening programs. At diagnosis, this information may also be helpful for identifying those patients who, based on their genetic risk profile, may warrant more aggressive initial therapy and also those who can be spared unnecessary therapy, thereby avoiding treatment-related morbidity.
