For instance, we find that PCSK9 statin response varies among self-reported Caucasian populations (Figure 1D), illustrating that even subtle differences in ancestry can affect drug response phenotypes. Different drug response phenotypes can be affected differently by ancestry, as illustrated by the fact that, unlike PCSK9 statin response, LDL-cholesterol statin response does not differ among Caucasians but does differ between Caucasians and African Americans.

Further studies such as replication in an independent population and functional follow-up are necessary to validate the relationship between the WDR52 locus and PCSK9 statin response, as well as to identify the gene(s) underlying this association.
