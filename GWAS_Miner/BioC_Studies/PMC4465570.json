Up to now, pharmacogenetic studies have been focused on candidate genes implicated in the mechanisms of antidepressant drug action or in the pharmacokinetics of such drugs.

Mice under chronic stress treatment or with increased stress susceptibility (M.

Our power analysis suggested sufficient power to detect single effects with a relative genetic risk of 1.6. It appears, however, that the effect size of single SNPs to predict antidepressant treatment response is lower than expected. This challenges the suitability of GWA for pharmacogenetic studies in complex diseases. Another limiting factor is the heterogeneity of the investigated phenotype. We tried to address this by including clinical predictors of treatment outcome, but have to concede that other factors not considered in this analysis, e.g., environmental stress or the individual drug history, most likely contributed to the heterogeneity of the phenotype. Nevertheless, we were able to replicate the additive effects of a clinical predictor and a multi-locus response-allele score. The inclusion of patients in the GWA samples suffering from bipolar depression may be regarded as confounder. However, we did not detect differences between patients with unipolar or bipolar depression with respect to the genotype frequencies of the 328 SNPs selected for replication in the STAR*D sample (pcorrected>.48; data not shown). In addition, the results of multi-locus survival analysis suggested that the diagnosis of unipolar vs. bipolar depression has no effects on treatment outcome (p>.33; data not shown). A further limitation is the heterogeneity of antidepressant treatments in the GWA samples. However, the primary mode of action of all antidepressants is related to an enhancement of monoaminergic neurotransmission, and despite differences in the profile of receptor occupancy antidepressants show comparable efficacy across drug classes.
