However, the fraction of BMI variance that can be attributed to common SNPs is at the most 2%. Candidate gene studies in severe obesity have led to the identification of several rare, highly penetrant mutations involving the hypothalamic leptin-melanocortin pathway, with variants in the melanocortin 4 receptor (MC4R) being the most common, with a population prevalence of 1/1000.

Analysis of ~2 Million directly genotyped or imputed SNPs, under a log-additive model, revealed 29 loci with evidence of association with obesity (p<1x10-5) (Supplementary Table 1). These 29 SNPs were taken forward for validation in additional 971 severely obese children and 1990 controls (Methods). Joint analysis of discovery and validation stages, including up to 2480 cases and 7370 controls identified nine genome-wide significant signals in eight loci (p<5x10-8; Table 1; Figure 1). Three mapped in or near PRKCH, PACS1 and RMST and have not been previously associated with obesity (Figure 1 and Figure 2). These genes are ubiquitously expressed (Supplementary Figure 1) and to date their role in energy homeostasis is unknown. A significant finding was that of a novel association with an intermediate frequency allele (rs11208659, 6% MAF in CEU HapMap) in the gene encoding the leptin receptor (LEPR). Homozygous loss of function LEPR variants can lead to monogenic obesity. To test whether this signal was driven by rare causal mutations, we sequenced all cases carrying at least one predisposing (C) allele on whom DNA was available (286/295); none had homozygous LEPR mutations and the three rare non-synonymous changes identified are unlikely to be sufficient to drive the association signal (data not shown), arguing against the LEPR signal being driven by causal mutations and suggests that a more common LEPR allele can influence predisposition to severe obesity. An analysis collapsing directly genotyped low-frequency SNPs (MAF <5%) across the discovery sample set did not find a statistically significant accumulation of rare SNPs in any loci apart from LEPR. However, the rare variant association signal at the LEPR locus was driven by the lead SNP (rs11208659); adjusting for this SNP abolished the association signal (data not shown). We also found that the risk allele (C) at the LEPR locus is associated with lower LEPR expression in monocytes (p = 0.0321, Supplementary Figure 2). Given the established importance of LEPR-mediated signalling in energy homeostasis, this might suggest that the association with obesity may be mediated by a reduction in levels of LEPR expression.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 4613, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The remaining four obesity associated loci (in or near, FTO, MC4R, TMEM18 and NEGR1) have been reported previously. As our cases lie at the very extreme end of the BMI distribution, there are very few other cohorts of sufficient size and comparable severity of obesity for replication. Consistent with this, on comparing our genome-wide significant results to other GWAS for childhood obesity and for varying degrees of obesity in adults and children (Supplementary Table 2), we found there was relatively little overlap, other than for FTO, TMEM18 and MC4R. To explore the differences between our results and those from large-scale meta-analysis of BMI in population-based cohorts, we compared our results with those obtained from the GIANT consortium (Supplementary Tables 3 and 4, Supplementary Figures 3 and 4). For several GIANT loci we did not obtain genome-wide significant support for association in our cohort with severe early onset obesity although 14 loci had directionally consistent associations at nominal significance levels (p<0.05), more than expected by chance pbinomial= 6.10x10-5 (Supplementary Table 4, Supplementary Figure 4. Some of these differences are accounted for by differences in power as our sample size is much smaller than that of GIANT; power calculations showed that we had < 80% power to detect signals other than FTO, TMEM18 and MC4R at genome-wide levels of significance (Methods). This observation may also reflect differences in susceptibility to early versus adult onset obesity or in alleles associated with BMI in the obese vs severely obese range (Supplementary Table 2). Indeed the data suggest that while there is significant overlap between the loci influencing BMI and common obesity and those influencing severe obesity, this overlap is incomplete and the relative contribution of each locus to common and severe forms of obesity also differs. For example, while FTO is the locus with the largest reported effect size in several population studies, our results show that there are other loci with comparable or greater effect sizes on severe early onset obesity (Table 1). Also, while NEGR1 (tagging the 40kb deletion) and SH2B1, both have similar effect sizes in GIANT, the effect of SH2B1 is much smaller in SCOOP (Supplementary Table 4, Supplementary Figure 4). Construction of a risk score with the SNPs from GIANT available in our data also suggests that the severely obese cases seen in SCOOP do not have an increased burden of established BMI loci (mean risk score = 27.2), suggesting they may be due to different risk alleles. Similarly, data from GIANT do not support the association of the new SCOOP loci with BMI in population-derived cohorts (Supplementary Table 3, Supplementary Figure 3). However, in the recent GIANT discovery sample (N=123,865), only 167 individuals would have a comparable BMI to SCOOP cases, so the lack of replication does not preclude an effect of these variants on severe obesity.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 7585, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "We analysed the SNP data to examine whether there was an excess in cases of homozygosity by descent (HBD), either genome-wide, or in specific genomic locations (Methods).

Our strongest association signal (p = 6.1x10-11), also supported by the SNP data, was of a protective ~8kb deletion upstream of NEGR1, with a weaker positive association signal (p=6.6x10-7) from a larger non-overlapping ~43kb deletion (72,541-72,584 kb) flanking the ~8kb deletion (Figure 3). These deletions are known to segregate on distinct haplotypes, and as the three alleles (43kb deletion, 8kb deletion and undeleted) are mutually exclusive, we tested whether the two deletion alleles were independently associated with severe obesity. The frequency of the undeleted allele is approximately the same in cases and controls and is not associated with the phenotype (OR (95% CI) =1 (0.90-1.1); p = 0.93, two-sided Fisher's exact test). When conditioned on the smaller deletion allele, the association of the larger deletion allele was completely abolished (OR (95% CI) = (0.97-1.22); p=0.16). However, when conditioned on the larger allele, the association of the smaller deletion remained significant (OR (95% CI) =0.70 (0.60-0.82); p=6.93x10-6), suggesting that the association signal at the NEGR1 locus in our cohort is largely driven by the protective effect of the ~8kb deletion allele. In keeping with these findings, we found that the SNP with the strongest association signal for obesity at this locus (rs1993709) tags the 8Kb deletion (Table 1) and conditional analyses performed at the SNP level are consistent with these findings (data not shown), highlighting the strength of the combined SNP and CNV analysis.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 9951, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Although the 8kb deletion does not disrupt the coding sequence of any gene, it encompasses a single conserved transcription factor binding site for NKX6.1 (Figure 4a and 4b), which is known to be involved in neuronal development in the mid and hindbrain.

NKX6.1 is a potent transcriptional repressor, so loss of binding would be predicted to lead to increased gene expression. In existing eQTL data, the small deletion appears to be associated with increased expression of NEGR1 in lymphoblastoid cell lines (p=0.0427, Supplementary Figure 6). Further studies will be needed to establish whether NEGR1 is transcriptionally regulated by NKX6.1 in relevant human tissues.

Here we used a permutation-based method to assess the statistical significance of genome-wide CNV burden (Methods). A significant enrichment in cases was observed for all CNVs >100kb in size and < 1% in frequency (Table 2; Supplementary Table 5). The most significant enrichment was observed in duplications in the range of 100-200kb and deletions >100kb in size. The enrichment of singleton CNVs is stronger than that of rare recurrent CNVs (1.8-fold increase, p=0.0001). We focused on the large number of obesity-specific deletions that were not detected in controls (765).-Whilst CNVs may contribute to disease by affecting regulatory regions of the genome, given the large number of rare CNVs identified in this study, we focused on CNVs that disrupt the exon sequence of 490 genes (in 336 patients) where we can more directly infer pathogenicity due to dosage sensitivity. To examine whether these 490 genes converged on specific biological pathways, we conducted pathway enrichment analysis using Ingenuity Pathways Analysis (IPA); genes involved in nervous system development and/or function were significantly overrepresented (p=9.83x10 -5) (Supplementary Table 6). The most significant enrichment involved a network of 13 genes encoding G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) (Supplementary Figure 7); these CNVs were validated by an independent method, MLPA (data not shown). Several of the genes disrupted by these CNVs play an important role in energy homeostasis in animals, the mu-opioid receptor 1 (OPRM1), the follicle-stimulating hormone receptor (FSHR) and the oxytocin receptor (OXTR). In addition, genetic variation in the dopamine receptor D2 (DRD2) has been associated with eating behaviour and brain activation responses to images of food in humans.

These findings add to the body of evidence suggesting that both common and rare variants around specific genes/loci (LEPR, POMC, MC4R, BDNF, SH2B1) are involved in the pathogenesis of obesity. We show that there is an incomplete overlap between loci influencing risk of severe obesity and those that influence more common obesity, as detected by studies in population-based cohorts, and that the relative contribution of each locus to severe versus common obesity also differs. Furthermore, we provide evidence that severe obesity without developmental delay is associated with a significantly increased burden of rare, typically singleton CNVs, in parallel with findings in intellectual disability. Using pathway analysis, we found that rare CNVs that delete genes involved in the neuronal regulation of energy homeostasis contribute to severe obesity; looking for rare coding variants in these genes may be fruitful.
