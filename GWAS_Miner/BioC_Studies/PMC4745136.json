The five new SNPs for serum metabolite levels are also all located nearby such genes, and their associations with metabolites tend to match the known function of these genes. SNP rs7582179 in the AGPS gene is associated with the choline plasmalogen PC ae C44:5. Mutations in AGPS (encoding the enzyme alkylglycerone phosphate synthase) are known to cause rhizomelic chondrodysplasia punctata type 3 (RCDP3; OMIM:600121), a rare autosomal recessive disorder that is fatal, with death occurring often early in childhood. Clinically, RCDP3 is characterized by significantly delayed and abnormal physical and mental development, with shortness of the proximal limb bones ('rhizomelia') being one of the hallmarks. RCDP3 has been shown to result from reduced production of plasmalogens (a type of ether phospholipids) by alkylglycerone phosphate synthase in peroxisomes. The association in the current study of a SNP within the AGPS gene with the serum concentration of the choline plasmalogen PC ae C44:5 is therefore perfectly concordant with the known gene-disease link between AGPS and RCDP3. PC ae C44:5 also associated significantly with the new SNP rs7700133 located near the ACSL1 gene, encoding long-chain acyl CoA synthetase 1. Previous studies have shown links between genetic and transcriptional variation of ACSL1 and the metabolic syndrome. The new SNP rs12210538, located within the SLC22A16 gene, associated with the two acylcarnitines C18:1 and C18:2. This gene encodes a carnitine transporter that mediates the uptake of anticancer drugs such as bleomycin and doxorubicin into tumour cells, and its activity correlates with treatment response. Significant associations were found for two SNPs (rs17657817 and rs2246012) located inside the ARG1 gene (coding for the enzyme arginase) with serum concentrations of the amino acid ornithine that participates in the urea cycle. Importantly, the global arginine bioavailability ratio (that is, the ratio of arginine to ornithine and citrulline) is of interest as a potential biomarker for endothelial dysfunction, which is a known risk factor for the development of cardiovascular disease. The two newly identified SNPs associated with serum ornithine levels might now be used as instrumental variables in cost-effective Mendelian randomization studies in large samples of individuals, to investigate the possible causal relationship among ornithine, endothelial dysfunction and subsequent cardiovascular disease. Among three meta-analyses of coronary artery disease and myocardial infarction as carried out by the CARDIoGRAMplusC4D Consortium, the association with SNP rs2246012 was the strongest in the CARDIoGRAM GWA study (P < 0.002) involving 22,233 cases and 64,762 controls.

These new associations strengthen the evidence for the associations of these known SNPs with specific metabolites, demonstrating their extended effect on phenotypes that are closely related to the metabolites with which their association was discovered initially. Also, it has been demonstrated that GWA studies with the more refined metabolic phenotypes provided by metabolomics often yield effect sizes that are larger than those observed in GWA studies of composite measures such as high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, suggesting that these more refined metabolomic phenotypes provide better intermediate traits.

The method of AbsoluteIDQ p150 kit has been proven to be in conformance with FDA Guideline 'Guidance for Industry:Bioanalytical Method Validation (May 2001)', which implies proof of reproducibility within a given error range. For all cohorts, metabolite measurements were carried out at the Metabolomics Platform of the Genome Analysis Center at the Helmholtz Zentrum Munchen, Germany as per the manufacturer's instructions. In brief, the used metabolomic measurement technique is based on a targeted profiling scheme that is used to quantitatively screen for known small-molecule metabolites by multiple reaction monitoring, neutral loss and precursor-ion scans. Internal standards served as reference for the calculation of all metabolite concentrations, which are reported as micromolar. Data evaluation for quantification of metabolite concentrations and quality assessment have been performed with the MetIDQ software package, which is an integral part of the AbsoluteIDQ kit. Stability of the assay was assessed using the measurement results of five aliquots of the same reference blood sample on every plate. Quality control of the Biocrates metabolite concentration measurement data was performed by each participating cohort as follows: for each cohort, metabolite profile measurements for all individuals were performed on multiple plates. For each metabolite i and plate j, the coefficient of variation (CVi,j) was calculated as: CVi,j = s.d.i,j / meani,j, where the standard deviation (s.d.) and mean were calculated over all reference measurements per plate j (five per plate). Summary statistics for the metabolite concentration data for each cohort were compared with the measurement detection limit specifications as reported by the manufacturer of the AbsoluteIDQ p150 kit (BIOCRATES). A metabolite was excluded from further analyses for a particular cohort if its concentration measurement data did not meet all of the following criteria: (i) mean CVi over all plates < 25%; (ii) <= 5% missing values; (iii) median >= lower limit of quantification (for metabolites reported as absolute concentrations) or >= limit of detection (for semiquantitatively measured metabolites). Outlying metabolite concentration values (data points) and outlying samples were also removed, and the missing data points were imputed with the 'R' package 'mice'. The resulting concentration data for each metabolite were natural log-transformed in order to attain a normal distribution.

For the KORA S4 replication sample, SNP genotypes were imputed against the 1,000 g phase1 integrated haplotypes reference set. Association analysis was performed assuming a linear regression model for each SNP, adjusting for relatedness, age, sex and study specific (for example, ancestry-informative principal component scores) covariates as necessary (see Supplementary Table 2). Positions of all SNPs described in the current manuscript were mapped to those as in the HapMap 2 Build 36 release 24 reference set (hg18). Meta-analysis of GWA results obtained in the cohorts participating in stage 1 was performed as follows: the expected minor allele count (eMAC) was computed at the cohort level for each SNP as  where N is the study sample size, MAF is the minor allele frequency and IA is the SNP genotype imputation quality measure. SNPs for which eMAC < 25 were filtered out of the GWA results for the cohort under consideration. After applying genomic control at the individual cohort level, two independent analysts carried out additive model fixed-effects meta-analysis of association data for imputed autosomal SNPs, using two different software packages (METAL and GWAMA). For a given SNP, cohort-specific effect size estimates were weighted inversely with their variance. Throughout the manuscript, we report the P values as resulting from Z-tests of association as carried out by METAL.

Such a multi-SNP predictor, or PGS, reflects the weighted sum of multiple SNPs associated with a phenotype. The discovery meta-analysis forms the basis to select SNPs based on liberal significance thresholds (for example, 0.001, 0.01 and so on). In the target sample, PGSs are calculated for each individual for each set of SNPs by multiplying the number of effect alleles per SNP (0, 1 or 2) with the beta from the meta-analysis, summed over all SNPs in the set of SNPs. We performed the PGS analysis using the regression coefficients (betas) from the discovery phase meta-analyses as weights. Analyses were performed for the 127 metabolites for which concentration data were available both in the discovery sample and in the KORA S4 target sample. For each of these metabolites, SNPs representing approximately independent association signals were selected in the discovery phase meta-analysis results using the PLINK clumping procedure. SNPs with P values of association with metabolite concentration levels in the discovery meta-analysis below the following thresholds were included: P < 1.0 x 10-8; P < 1.0 x 10-7; P < 1.0 x 10-6; P < 1.0 x 10-5; P < 1.0 x 10-4; P < 1.0 x 10-3; P < 1.0 x 10-2; P < 5.0 x 10-2; P < 0.1; P < 0.2; P < 0.3; P < 0.4; P < 0.5; P < 0.6; P < 0.7; P < 0.8; P < 0.9; P < 1.0. For each clump of SNPs, the index SNP was taken for possible inclusion in the score computation. From the resulting set of SNPs eligible for inclusion in the PGS analysis, A/T and G/C SNPs for which (0.35 < MAF < 0.50) were excluded because these SNPs are potentially ambiguous and therefore may lead to spurious association in the case of strand flips. From the imputed SNP genotype data for the KORA S4 target sample, the SNPs corresponding with the remaining clump index SNPs were selected. A PGS was constructed for each individual in the KORA S4 replication sample using the '--score' procedure as implemented in PLINK v. 1.07 (http://pngu.mgh.harvard.edu/Bpurcell/plink/profile.shtml). The resulting PGS was included as a covariate in a multiple linear regression analysis that was similar to the regression that was carried out in the primary single SNP-based GWA analysis:  where y represents log(metabolite) values, and the study-specific covariates include adjustments for, for example, population stratification (and thus beta4 can be a vector). The Biocrates metabolite values were obtained and preprocessed using the same methods as described for the primary GWA in the Section 'Biocrates metabolite quantification'. The proportion of variance explained by the PGSs was assessed by comparing the raw (that is, unadjusted) R2 values for the 'full' model (that is, a model including the genetic score as a covariate) with the raw R2 values when fitting a 'reduced' model that did not include the genetic score as a covariate.
