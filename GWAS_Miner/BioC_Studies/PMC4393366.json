Subcortical brain regions form circuits with cortical areas to coordinate movement, learning, memory and motivation, and altered circuits can lead to abnormal behaviour and disease. To investigate how common genetic variants affect the structure of these brain regions, here we conduct genome-wide association studies of the volumes of seven subcortical regions and the intracranial volume derived from magnetic resonance images of 30,717 individuals from 50 cohorts. We identify five novel genetic variants influencing the volumes of the putamen and caudate nucleus. We also find stronger evidence for three loci with previously established influences on hippocampal volume and intracranial volume. These variants show specific volumetric effects on brain structures rather than global effects across structures. The strongest effects were found for the putamen, where a novel intergenic locus with replicable influence on volume (rs945270; P = 1.08 x 10-33; 0.52% variance explained) showed evidence of altering the expression of the KTN1 gene in both brain and blood tissue. Variants influencing putamen volume clustered near developmental genes that regulate apoptosis, axon guidance and vesicle transport.

Within the context of the Enhancing Neuro Imaging Genetics through Meta-Analysis (ENIGMA) consortium, we conducted a collaborative large-scale genetic analysis of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans to identify genetic variants that influence brain structure. Here, we focus on volumetric measures derived from a measure of head size (intracranial volume, ICV) and seven subcortical brain structures corrected for the ICV (nucleus accumbens, caudate, putamen, pallidum, amygdala, hippocampus and thalamus). To ensure data homogeneity within the ENIGMA consortium, we designed and implemented standardized protocols for image analysis, quality assessment, genetic imputation (to 1000 Genomes references, version 3) and association (Extended Data Fig. 1 and Methods).", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 2488, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "After establishing that the volumes extracted using our protocols were substantially heritable in a large sample of twins (P < 1 x 10-4; see Methods and Extended Data Fig. 11a), with similar distributions to previous studies, we sought to identify common genetic variants contributing to volume differences by meta-analysing site-level genome-wide association study (GWAS) data in a discovery sample of 13,171 subjects of European ancestry (Extended Data Fig. 2). Population stratification was controlled for by including, as covariates, four population components derived from standardized multidimensional scaling analyses of genome-wide genotype data conducted at each site (see Methods). Site-level GWAS results and distributions were visually inspected to check for statistical inflation and patterns indicating technical artefacts (see Methods).", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 3343, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Meta-analysis of the discovery sample identified six genome-wide significant loci after correcting for the number of variants and traits analysed (P < 7.1 x 10-9; see Methods): one associated with the ICV, two associated with hippocampal volume, and three with putamen volume. Another four loci showed suggestive associations (P < 1 x 10-7) with putamen volume (one locus), amygdala volume (two loci), and caudate volume (one locus; Table 1, Fig. 1 and Supplementary Table 5). Quantile-quantile plots showed no evidence of population stratification or cryptic relatedness (Extended Data Fig. 4a). We subsequently attempted to replicate the variants with independent data from 17,546 individuals. All subcortical genome-wide significant variants identified in the discovery sample were replicated (Table 1). The variant associated with the ICV did not replicate in a smaller independent sample, but was genome-wide significant in a previously published independent study, providing strong evidence for its association with the ICV. Moreover, two suggestive variants associated with putamen and caudate volumes exceeded genome-wide significance after meta-analysis across the discovery and replication data sets (Table 1). Effect sizes were similar across cohorts (P > 0.1, Cochran's Q test; Extended Data Fig. 4b). Effect sizes remained consistent after excluding patients diagnosed with anxiety, Alzheimer's disease, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, bipolar disorder, epilepsy, major depressive disorder or schizophrenia (21% of the discovery participants). Correlation in effect size with and without patients was very high (r > 0.99) for loci with P < 1 x 10-5, indicating that these effects were unlikely to be driven by disease (Extended Data Fig. 5a). The participants' age range covered most of the lifespan (9-97 years), but only one of the eight significant loci showed an effect related to the mean age of each cohort (P = 0.002; rs6087771 affecting putamen volume; Extended Data Fig. 5b), suggesting that nearly all effects are stable across the lifespan. In addition, none of these loci showed evidence of sex effects (Extended Data Fig. 5c).", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 5525, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "In our cohorts, significant loci were associated with 0.51-1.40% differences in volume per risk allele, explaining 0.17-0.52% of the phenotypic variance (Table 1); such effect sizes are similar to those of common variants influencing other complex quantitative traits such as height and bodymass index. The full genome-wide association results explained 7-15% of phenotypic variance after controlling for the effects of covariates (Extended Data Fig. 11). Notably, the genome-wide significant variants identified here showed specific effects on single brain structures rather than pleiotropic effects across multiple structures, despite similar developmental origins as in the case of caudate and putamen (Extended Data Fig. 6a). Nevertheless, when we subjected the subcortical meta-analysis results to hierarchical clustering, genetic determinants of the subcortical structures were mostly grouped into larger circuits according to their developmental and functional subdivisions (Extended Data Fig. 6b). Genetic variants may therefore have coherent effects on functionally associated subcortical networks. Multivariate cross-structure analyses confirmed the univariate results, but no additional loci reached genome-wide significance (Extended Data Fig. 6c). The clustering of results into known brain circuits in the absence of individually significant genetic variants found in the cross-structure analysis suggests variants of small effect may have similar influences across structures. Most variants previously reported to be associated with brain structure and/or function showed little evidence of large-scale volumetric effects (Supplementary Table 8). We detected an intriguing association with hippocampal volume at a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) with a genome-wide significant association with schizophrenia (rs2909457; P = 2.12 x 10-6; where the A allele is associated with decreased risk for schizophrenia and decreased hippocampal volume).

Second, we identified an intronic locus within DCC (rs62097986; 18q21.2; n = 28,036; P = 1.01 x 10-13), which encodes a netrin receptor involved in axon guidance and migration, including in the developing striatum (Extended Data Fig. 3b). Expression of DCC throughout the brain is highest in the first two trimesters of prenatal development (Extended Data Fig. 8b), suggesting that this variant may influence brain volumes early in neurodevelopment. Third, we identified an intronic locus within BCL2L1 (rs6087771; 20q11.21; n = 25,540; P = 1.28 x 10-12), which encodes an anti-apoptotic factor that inhibits programmed cell death of immature neurons throughout the brain (Extended Data Fig. 3c). Consistent with this, expression of BCL2L1 in the striatum strongly decreases at the end of neurogenesis (24-38 post-conception weeks (PCW); Extended Data Fig. 8c), a period marked by increased apoptosis in the putamen. Fourth, we identified an intronic locus within DLG2 (rs683250; 11q14.1; n = 26,258; P = 3.94 x 10-11), which encodes the postsynaptic density 93 (PSD-93) protein (Extended Data Fig. 3d). PSD-93 is a membrane-associated guanylate kinase involved in organizing channels in the postsynaptic density. DLG2 expression increases during early mid-fetal development in the striatum (Extended Data Fig. 8d). Genetic variants in DLG2 affect learning and cognitive flexibility and are associated with schizophrenia. Notably, SNPs associated with variation in putamen volume showed enrichment of genes involved in apoptosis and axon guidance pathways (Extended Data Fig. 7 and Supplementary Table 7).", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 9623, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Hippocampal volume showed an intergenic association near the HRK gene (rs77956314; 12q24.22; n = 17,190; P = 2.82 x 10-15; Extended Data Fig. 3g) and with an intronic locus in the MSRB3gene (rs61921502; 12q14.3; n = 16,209; P = 6.87x 10-11; Extended Data Fig. 3h), supporting our previous analyses of smaller samples imputed to HapMap3 references.

This gene encodes a cadherin specifically expressed in the nervous system during embryonic development that influences neuronal morphology through cell-cell interactions. The ICV was associated with an intronic locus within CRHR1 that tags the chromosome 17q21 inversion, which has been previously found to influence ICV (rs17689882; 17q21.31; n = 12,822; P = 7.72 x 10-9; Extended Data Fig. 3f).

Epigenetic markers suggest insulator functionality near the locus as this is the lone chromatin mark in the intergenic region (Extended Data Fig. 3a). Chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-seq) indicate that a variant (rs8017172) in complete linkage disequilibrium with rs945270 (r2 = 1.0) lies within a binding site of the CTCF (CCCTC-binding factor) transcription regulator (Extended Data Fig. 9) in embryonic stem cells. To assess potential functionality in brain tissue, we tested for association with gene expression 1 megabase (Mb) up/downstream. We identified and replicated an effect of rs945270 on the expression of the KTN1 gene. The C allele, associated with larger putamen volume, also increased expression of KTN1 in the frontal cortex (discovery sample: 304 neuropathologically normal controls (P = 4.1 x 10-11); replication sample: 134 neuropathologically normal controls (P = 0.025)), and putamen (sample: 134 neuropathologically normal controls (P = 0.049); Fig. 2a, b). In blood, rs945270 was also strongly associated with KTN1 expression (P = 5.94 x 10-31; n = 5,311). After late fetal development, KTN1 is expressed in the human thalamus, striatum and hippocampus; it is more highly expressed in the striatum than the cortex (Extended Data Fig. 8a). KTN1 encodes the kinectin receptor facilitating vesicle binding to kinesin, and is heavily involved in organelle transport. Kinectin is only found in the dendrites and soma of neurons, not their axons; neurons with more kinectin have larger cell bodies, and kinectin knockdown strongly influences cell shape. The volumetric effects identified here may therefore reflect genetic control of neuronal cell size and/or dendritic complexity. Using three-dimensional surface models of putamen segmentations in MRI scans of 1,541 healthy adolescent subjects, we further localized the allelic effects of rs945270 to regions along the superior and lateral putamen bilaterally, independent of chosen segmentation protocol (Fig. 2c and Extended Data Fig. 10).

Plots indicate the effect of each genetic variant, quantified as percentage variance explained, on the eight volumetric phenotypes studied. As expected, the SNPs identified with influence on a phenotype show the highest effect size for that phenotype: putamen volume (rs945270, rs62097986, rs608771 and rs683250), hippocampal volume (rs77956314 and rs61921502), caudate volume (rs1318862) and ICV (rs17689882). In general much smaller effects are observed on other structures. b, Correlation heat map of GWAS test statistics (t-values) and hierarchical clustering. Independent SNPs were chosen within an linkage disequilibrium block based on the highest association in the multivariate cross-structure analysis described in Extended Data Fig. 6c. Two heat maps are shown taking only independent SNPs with either P < 1 x 10-4 (left) or P < 0.01 (right) in the multivariate cross-structure analysis. Different structures are labelled in developmentally similar regions by the colour bar on the top and side of the heat map including basal ganglia (putamen, pallidum, caudate and accumbens; blue), amygdalo-hippocampal complex (hippocampus and amygdala; red), thalamus (turquoise) and ICV (black). Hierarchical clustering showed that developmentally similar regions have mostly similar genetic influences across the entire genome. The low correlation with the ICV is owing to it being used as a covariate in the subcortical structure GWAS associations. c, A multivariate cross-structure analysis of all volumetric brain traits. A Manhattan plot (left) and corresponding quantile-quantile plot (right) of multivariate GWAS analysis of all traits (volumes of the accumbens, amygdala, caudate, hippocampus, pallidum, putamen, thalamus, and ICV) in the discovery data set using the TATES method is shown.

The number of independent traits was calculated by accounting for the non-independence of each of the eight traits examined (described in the Methods). Variants that influence the putamen were clustered near genes known to be involved in DSCAM interactions, neuronal arborization and axon guidance. Variants that influence intracranial volume are clustered near genes involved in EGFR and phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase (PI(3)K)/AKT signalling pathways, known to be involved in neuronal survival. All of these represent potential mechanisms by which genetic variants influence brain structure.
