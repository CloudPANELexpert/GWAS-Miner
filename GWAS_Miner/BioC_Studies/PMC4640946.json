Finally, it must be noted that a prior study of the GAIN portion of this sample by Winham and colleagues reported an association for the APOB gene with binge eating behavior in bipolar disorder that we were unable to confirm. This discrepancy is likely due to several factors. First, we have added the TGEN cohort, nearly doubling the overall sample size, although possibly introducing genetic heterogeneity due to differences in ascertainment methods between the bipolar cohorts. Second, we relied on a more stringent definition of eating disorders, requiring a confirmed diagnosis for categorization as comorbidity, whereas the Winham study categorized subjects according to a broader binge eating phenotype via a single DIGS question. As an example, our study identified only 60 patients with BD+ED from the GAIN cohort with the remaining 124 derived from TGEN, whereas the Winham study identified 206 bipolar patients with binge eating behavior in the GAIN cohort alone. Lastly, we used a combined eating disorder diagnosis that included both anorexia and bulimia to increase the sample size, which may have introduced genetic heterogeneity and divergence from the prior study. We thus expect different results from these studies employing alternative phenotype definitions in overlapping yet distinct cohorts.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 27366, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "In summary, we confirmed the association of a recently identified candidate gene for anorexia nervosa in bipolar patients with eating disorder comorbidity. We also identified several genomic regions of interest containing genes involved in neurodevelopment and neuroprotection processes that may be relevant to the specific pathophysiology of eating disorder comorbidity in bipolar disorder or may represent part of the shared pathophysiology underlying both bipolar disorder and eating disorders. Although these findings require confirmation in larger datasets, they support the concept that different clinical manifestations of bipolar disorder may reflect differences in the underlying genetic architecture.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 28077, "infons": {"section_type": "SUPPL", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "Supplementary Material", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 28100, "infons": {"section_type": "SUPPL", "type": "footnote"}, "text": "This is a PDF file of an unedited manuscript that has been accepted for publication.
