Over a 10 year period, approximately 80% of patients can expect to develop a complication and close to 50% of CD patients will progress to surgery. This is in contrast to the small percentage of patients presenting with a complication, and requiring surgery at time of diagnosis. One of the biggest challenges facing clinicians today is predicting which patients will progress to complication resulting in intestinal resection. The identification of these \"rapidly progressive\" patients early in the course of their disease may assist in the decision regarding the early introduction of effective intervention strategies and customizing therapies based on risk of underlying disease. Those at highest risk of disease complication may well benefit most from early use of immunomodulators and/or biologic therapies. Clinical factors, such as extensive small bowel and perianal disease location, earlier age at diagnosis, and use of corticosteroids have been shown to be associated with \"disabling\" CD. Antibodies to microbial antigens have been shown repeatedly to be associated with complicated disease behaviors and need for surgery. Both the number of antibodies as well as the magnitude of the antibody response has been reported to be associated with surgical intervention in both the pediatric and adult CD populations. Recently, a risk prediction tool demonstrated that the use of biologics within the first 90 days of diagnosis in a child predicted to be at high risk of disease progression resulted in a 75% absolute risk reduction in disease complication rate as compared to children not treated with biologics within this time frame. This is the first study to demonstrate a change in the natural history in a predicted at risk population of CD patients. Despite major advances in genome discovery, there have only been a few studies that have considered the role of genetics in determining disease behavior. Variation in NOD2/CARD15 has been shown to be associated with stricturing CD, need for surgery as well as surgical recurrence. Henckaerts et al reported on over 30 loci known to be associated with CD and changes in disease behavior and need for surgery. The rs1363670 G allele near the IL12B gene was found to be independently associated with both stricturing disease and more rapid development of strictures. Recent studies have extended the number of CD loci achieving association at a genome-wide level to 71. In looking for genes that predict natural history in CD, a logical place to start would be with the known susceptibility loci, but it is also quite possible that non-susceptibility loci contribute to disease behavior, as has been demonstrated in coronary artery disease. These concepts justify testing associations with known CD loci and identifying novel loci using a whole genome approach for finding loci that influence the development of complications and surgery. The aims of this study were to identify associations between known CD susceptibility loci and novel genetic loci with need for resective surgery in CD patients and to develop the best predictive model for resective CD surgery using a combination of clinical, serologic and genetic variables. The identification of CD patients at highest risk for early resective surgery would be helpful to patients and clinicians alike in guiding initial therapy and identifying patients who would benefit most from early effective intervention.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 5540, "infons": {"section_type": "METHODS", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "Methods", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 5548, "infons": {"section_type": "METHODS", "type": "title_2"}, "text": "Patient Population", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 5567, "infons": {"section_type": "METHODS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "A total of 1115 well characterized CD patients from both the Adult and Pediatric IBD Centers at CSMC, The Western Regional Research Alliance for Pediatric IBD and Wisconsin were included in this study.

The proportion of patients in the lowest strata score that progressed to surgery within 60 months was significantly less (15%) than the medium(22%) and highest strata (36%) (log rank test: p=3.2x10-6). In the clinical variables only model(Model II) only small bowel predicted time to surgery (HR [95% CI] 3.3 [1.9-5.6] p=1.28x10-5) and neither age at diagnosis or gender showed statistically significant association with time to surgery. For model IV (genetics + clinical) all 4 SNPs from the genetics only model along with small bowel disease location and age at diagnosis(HR [95% CI] = 3.2 [1.9 - 5.4] p=2.2x10-5 and 1.5 [1.1 - 2.0] p = 0.02, respectively)were associated with time to surgery. Figure 1B illustrates the survival curves for the 3 strata for model IV. In our final model (Model V) which included NOD2 and quartile sum score groups in addition to genetic and clinical variables, NOD2(HR [95% CI]; 1.7 [1.2-2.5]; p = 0.006), 3 of the 4 SNPS from the genetics only model (IL12B, ZNRF1 and 21q21) in addition to small bowel disease location and age at diagnosis were all associated with time to surgery. Quartile sum scores were not predictive of surgery. As seen in Model I, patients in the highest risk strata progressed to surgery faster for models IV and V(p= 1.7x10-10 and p = 1.0x10-6, respectively) Moreover, there was a greater than 20% difference in frequency of progression to surgery between the lowest risk and highest risk strata in all 3 models. The AUC for the 5 models are shown in Table 8. The AUC of all 5 models was validated by 5-fold cross validation (80/20) and no difference was seen between any of the discovery and validation cohorts. Model IV and V had the highest AUC amongst the 5 models which were also very similar AUCs (0.65 [0.62-0.68] and 0.67 [0.65-0.69], respectively). The confidence intervals of these 2 models did not overlap with the genetics only model (AUC = 0.59 [0.57-.60]. The AUC for the clinical only model was the lowest (0.24 [0.22-0.27].", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 22630, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "Discussion", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 22641, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The ability to identify CD patients with a more aggressive natural history would be of benefit to both clinicians and patients and a major step on the road to a more personalized or individualized approach to clinical care. This study of over 1100 well-characterized CD cases is the first to include demographic, clinical, serological and genetic parameters to predict the need for early intestinal resection surgery in CD. The most intriguing finding is the consistent association between the 1L12B locus and both the need for surgery and time to surgery, a finding that remains significant through all the model development, and remains significant after correcting for multiple-testing in our hypothesis driven analyses.IL12B (also known as natural killer cell stimulatory factor 2 or p40) associates with IL23A to form IL23, a known stimulator of the Jak-Stat signaling pathway and a pathway with proven importance in IBD.This locus has previously been associated with complicated disease in CD and also the need for colectomy in medically refractory ulcerative colitis. These cumulative data strongly implicate this locus not only in disease susceptibility but also in the natural history of IBD and together, with both our current understanding of the biological relevance of this pathway and also the potential role of anti-IL12 therapies in IBD, suggests the intriguing and attractive possibility of targeted anti-IL12 therapy in these high-risk groups.

However, none of the putative loci met the criteria for genome-wide level of significance (< 5x10-8). Thus, our putative disease severity associated SNPs will need to be replicated in other cohorts. Nevertheless a number of loci met genome-wide suggestive association (Tables 3 and 6), including the HLA region (tagging HLA B/C and MICA (a stress induced antigen recognized by intestinal epithelial gamma delta T cells)) associated with a number of immune related conditions including UC, Behcet's, Type 1 Diabetes, lupus, and psoriasis. Other implicated genes of potential interest include: CACNA2D1 which has a role in apoptosis, PLEKHG5 (NFkB activator); THAP3 (apoptotic pathway modifier); SPATA13 (cell adhesion and associated with intestinal adenoma formation); and SKAP2 (macrophage adhesion). The major finding of this study is that the combination of different parameters provides an improved predictor of progression to surgery in CD than any single parameter. The data demonstrate that progression to surgery is more accurately predicted in patients with CD who 'carry' both clinical and genetic factors with clear improvements as different risk variables are added to the model. Our findings suggest that if models are to be utilized in clinical practice to facilitate the development of a more individualized approach to managing CD patients, then they should, at least, include these different parameters for maximum differentiation of risk groups and hence the greatest utility in clinical practice.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 25847, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "We recognize that this model will need to be validated in another cohort which is currently underway.
