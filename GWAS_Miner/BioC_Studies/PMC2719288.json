We describe a joint GWA study (using the Affymetrix GeneChip 500K Mapping Array Set) undertaken in the British population, which has examined ~2,000 individuals for each of 7 major diseases and a shared set of ~3,000 controls. Case-control comparisons identified 24 independent association signals at P<5x10-7: 1 in bipolar disorder, 1 in coronary artery disease, 9 in Crohn's disease, 3 in rheumatoid arthritis, 7 in type 1 diabetes and 3 in type 2 diabetes. On the basis of prior findings and replication studies thus-far completed, almost all of these signals reflect genuine susceptibility effects. We observed association at many previously identified loci, and found compelling evidence that some loci confer risk for more than one of the diseases studied. Across all diseases, we identified a large number of further signals (including 58 loci with single-point P values between 10-5 and 5x10-7) likely to yield additional susceptibility loci. The importance of appropriately large samples was confirmed by the modest effect sizes observed at most loci identified. This study thus represents a thorough validation of the GWA approach. It has also demonstrated that careful use of a shared control group represents a safe and effective approach to GWA analyses of multiple disease phenotypes; has generated a genome-wide genotype database for future studies of common diseases in the British population; and shown that, provided individuals with non-European ancestry are excluded, the extent of population stratification in the British population is generally modest.

Our study demonstrates that, within the context of large-scale genetic association studies, for British populations at least, this concern has been overstated.

Separately for each SNP with MAF >5% in the 10 HapMap ENCODE regions, we assumed the SNP was causative and simulated genotype data at all SNPs in the same region as the putative disease SNP in case-control panels of 2,000 cases and 3,000 controls with linkage disequilibrium patterns that match those in HapMap. For controls, these simulations were based on the imputation algorithm described below (with all genotype data initially set to missing in the 3,000 control individuals). For cases, the assumed effect size was first used to calculate genotype frequencies in cases (via Bayes' theorem), and genotypes in cases at the putative SNP were then simulated independently from theses calculated frequencies. Genotypes at all other SNPs in the region in cases were then simulated using the imputation algorithm described below (with all data other than the genotypes at the causative SNP initially set to missing in the cases). For each such simulated case-control panel, trend tests were performed at each of the SNPs in the region that are actually on the Affymetrix chip, and if any of these reached the stated P-value threshold the putative disease SNP was deemed to be detected, and otherwise to be undetected. Power estimates are then calculated as the proportion of putative disease SNPs with MAFs>5% across the HapMap ENCODE regions that are detected at the given P-value threshold. There are various approximations here. Actual numbers of cases and controls for each disease are slightly smaller than the 3,000:2,000 values used in the simulations, but in the other direction, our simulations ignore the possibility that a disease SNP might be detected by a genotyped SNP outside its ENCODE region. The accuracy reported below of the imputation algorithm in imputing genotypes leads us to believe these simulations should be a reasonable proxy for real data. Some such simulation is needed if power calculations are to take account of the fact that any given putative disease SNP could typically be detected by several SNPs on the chip.
