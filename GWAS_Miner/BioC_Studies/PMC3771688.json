From this analysis, we selected 35,084 SNPs on the basis of evidence of association with breast cancer, derived from a 1-degree-of-freedom trend test, a test weighted for family history, a 2-degrees-of-freedom test and subset analyses based on cases of breast cancer diagnosed before 40 years of age and before 50 years of age (Online Methods). In particular, we were able to select all SNPs or surrogate SNPs with 1-degree-of-freedom Ptrend < 0.008. To evaluate these SNPs, we then designed a custom Illumina iSelect genotyping array (iCOGS) in collaboration with three other consortia studying, in addition to breast cancer risk, susceptibility to ovarian cancer, prostate cancer and breast and ovarian cancers in BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers (COGS). The array included, in addition to SNPs selected from GWAS, SNPs selected for fine mapping of known susceptibility loci, functional candidate SNPs and SNPs related to other traits (Online Methods and Supplementary Note). The iCOGS array comprised 211,155 SNPs. These arrays were used to genotype 114,255 DNA samples from 52 studies participating in BCAC (Supplementary Table 2). After quality control exclusions (Online Methods and Supplementary Table 3), data were obtained for 199,961 SNPs in 52,675 cases and 49,436 controls. The analyses presented here are based on data from subjects of European ancestry (45,290 cases and 41,880 controls from 41 studies) and focus on 29,807 SNPs that were selected on the basis of the GWAS analysis that were successfully genotyped and were not located in regions previously known to be associated with breast cancer.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 3908, "infons": {"section_type": "RESULTS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The association between each SNP and breast cancer risk was tested using a 1-degree-of-freedom trend test adjusted for study and seven principal components (Online Methods). There was some evidence for inflation in the test statistics, detected using data from 22,897 uncorrelated SNPs on iCOGS not selected on the basis of breast cancer risk (lambda = 1.20, lambda1000 = 1.005; Supplementary Fig. 1a). There was, however, clear evidence of an excess of statistically significant associations among the SNPs selected from the GWAS analysis (Table 1 and Supplementary Fig. 1b). Although some excess was also observed among the SNPs not selected from the breast cancer GWAS, the excess of statistically significant associations was much more marked among the GWAS SNPs at all levels of statistical significance. In addition, of 21,128 SNPs not selected for breast cancer association that were also present in the combined GWAS data set, 10,864 (51%) had effects in the same direction in the GWAS and iCOGS data, and, for these SNPs, inflation was 1.26 (lambda1000 = 1.007) compared with 1.14 (lambda1000 = 1.0035) for SNPs with effects in opposite directions in the two stages. A similar direction of effect was seen for these SNPs in the combined GWAS (lambda = 0.87 for SNPs with effects in the same direction versus lambda = 0.79 for SNPs with effects in the opposite direction, with inflation being <1 because SNPs showing evidence of association were excluded). Taken together, these results suggest that much of the inflation in the test statistics for SNPs not selected for breast cancer association is also due to the effect of true associations. Moreover, some of the excess of statistically significant associations seen in the SNPs not selected for breast cancer association was due to SNPs close to breast cancer-associated SNPs. For example, of the 45 SNPs with significant association at P < 0.00001, 21 were within 1 Mb of 1 of the newly identified breast cancer loci identified at our set genome-wide significance threshold.

Three loci showed weaker evidence for association: rs1045485, encoding an Asp302His variant in CASP8, whose association was previously identified in a candidate gene study (P = 0.054 in the iCOGS stage; P = 0.0013 in combined data from the GWAS and iCOGS stages); rs2380205 at 10p15, identified in a GWAS but suggested to be a possible false positive association in a previous BCAC analysis (iCOGS P = 0.075; combined P = 0.0021); and rs8170 at 19p13.1, for which the association has been shown to be specific to estrogen receptor (ER)-negative breast cancer (P = 0.0027 in iCOGS; combined P = 0.0012).

In four regions (5q11.2, 8q21.11, 10p12.31 and 18q11.2), this set of SNPs included SNPs within 1 Mb of each other that were uncorrelated, such that a second SNP was associated with disease after adjustment for the most significantly associated SNP (Supplementary Fig. 4 and Supplementary Table 5). There was little or no evidence for heterogeneity in the per-allele odds ratios (ORs) among studies for any SNP (per-SNP I2 and P values are given in Supplementary Fig. 2 and Supplementary Table 6). Genotype-specific OR estimates were consistent with a log-additive (allele dose) model for most SNPs, with the exception of three SNPs (rs616488, rs204247 and rs720475) for which the heterozygotes had a similar OR as homozygotes for the high-risk allele and two SNPs (rs11242675 and rs6472903) that were more consistent with a recessive model (Supplementary Table 6). Consistent with the pattern seen for previously established loci, there was strong evidence for specificity of the association to tumor subtype. For 13 of the loci, the per-allele OR was higher for ER-positive disease than for ER-negative disease (case-only P < 0.05), in most instances with little or no evidence of an association with ER-negative disease (based on data from 7,465 ER-negative cases and 27,074 ER-positive cases; Supplementary Table 7a). The most notable differences were for SNP rs6828523 at 4q34.1 (ER-positive OR = 0.87 (95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.84-0.90); ER-negative OR = 1.01 (95% CI = 0.96-1.07); P for difference = 1.2 x 10-7) and for rs7072776 at 10p12.31, where the estimated effects were in opposite directions (ER-positive OR = 1.09 (95% CI = 1.06-1.12); ER-negative OR = 0.94 (95% CI = 0.90-0.98); P for difference = 3.1 x 10-10). No such difference was observed for the neighboring SNP rs11814448, which was associated with both ER-positive and ER-negative disease in the same direction. For one locus, SNP rs17817449 on chromosome 16, the association was stronger for ER-negative than for ER-positive disease (P for difference = 0.039). All SNPs showed comparable ORs for invasive and in situ disease (based on data from 2,335 ductal carcinoma in situ, DCIS, and 42,118 invasive cases), with the exceptions of rs12493607 and rs3903072, for which associations seemed to be restricted to invasive disease (Supplementary Table 7b). Two loci (rs2588809 at 14q24.1 (P = 0.001) and rs941764 at 14q32.12 (P = 0.007)) showed higher per-allele ORs for cases diagnosed at a young age (Supplementary Table 7c). Consistent with the predictions of a polygenic model of susceptibility, for 26 of the loci, the estimated OR was higher when restricted to cases with a positive family history for disease (significant at P < 0.05 for 5 loci), whereas for only 6 loci was the OR lower when restricted to cases with a positive family history (Supplementary Table 7d).", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 10167, "infons": {"section_type": "RESULTS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Four of the newly associated loci (rs16857609 at 2q35, rs10759243 at 9q31, rs11199914 at 10q26 and rs2588809 at 14q24) lie close to regions previously associated with breast cancer risk. In each locus, however, the lead SNP was not correlated with the most strongly associated known association, and the association of the new SNP remained similarly statistically significant after adjustment for the previously associated SNP (Supplementary Table 5).

MUS81 at 11q13 has a key role in the maintenance of genomic stability and in DNA repair pathways, and the cofilin gene (CFL1) is required for tumor cell motility and invasion, particularly in mammary tumors. Several other genes have been associated with tumor aggressiveness; these include PTH1R at 3p21, FOXQ1 at 6p25, ARHGEF5 at 7q35 and MKL1 at 22q13. PTH1R is the receptor for PTHLH, encoded by a previously identified breast cancer susceptibility locus. PTHLH is required for normal mammary gland function and has been shown to be involved in the metastasis of breast cancer cells to bone. FOXQ1 encodes a transcription factor with a key role in cell proliferation and migration and in breast cancer metastasis. Alterations in its expression level induce mesenchymal-epithelial transition. Dysfunctional ARHGEF5 acts as an oncogene specific for human breast tissue, with a crucial role in tumorigenesis and metastasis in breast cancer. MKL1 is also involved in tumor cell invasion and metastasis, particularly in human breast carcinoma. Two of the newly associated SNPs lie within the TCF7L2 and FTO genes, previously associated with type 2 diabetes and/or obesity through GWAS. TCF7L2 acts as a proto-oncogene and is involved in the Wnt pathway and in tumor formation. PAX9 at 14q13.3 encodes a transcription factor that regulates cell proliferation, migration and resistance to apoptosis. SSBP4 is involved in DNA recombination and repair and has been suggested to have tumor suppressor activity. The expression of KREMEN1 at 22q12.1 is lower or absent in human tumors compared to normal tissue. This gene encodes a negative regulator of the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway, which has a key role in cell fate determination, stem cell regulation and cell differentiation and proliferation. It has been suggested that lack of KREMEN1 would activate the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway, thereby enhancing susceptibility to tumorigenesis. Finally, NTN4 at 12q22 encodes a secreted growth factor that regulates tumor growth. High levels of NTN4 have been found in ER-positive but not ER-negative breast tumors. NTN4 expression in tumors has also been suggested as a potential prognostic marker for breast cancer.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 19669, "infons": {"section_type": "RESULTS", "type": "title_2"}, "text": "Overall contribution to breast cancer susceptibility", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 19722, "infons": {"section_type": "RESULTS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "On the assumption that the risks conferred by common susceptibility loci combine multiplicatively (no interaction on a log-additive scale) and on the basis of the per-allele OR estimates from the iCOGS stage, we determined that the 41 newly associated loci explain approximately 5% of the familial risk of breast cancer. However, the overall excess of significant associations for SNPs selected from the breast cancer GWAS for genotyping in the iCOGS stage suggests that a much larger number of loci contribute to susceptibility, although they did not have associations reaching genome-wide levels of significance in the current study. To assess this hypothesis more formally, we identified a set of 10,668 SNPs selected from the GWAS that were uncorrelated (r2 < 0.1 between any pair). Of these, the estimated OR was in the same direction as in the combined GWAS for 5,918 SNPs and in the opposite direction for 4,750 SNPs. Assuming that SNPs with effects in opposite directions are not associated with risk, an estimated 1,168 loci selected from the GWAS are associated with risk. However, this is an underestimate because weakly associated SNPs might have effects in opposite directions in the two stages. As an alternative approach, we fitted the distribution of z scores for the iCOGS stage, aligned to the direction of the effect in the GWAS, as a mixture of two normal distributions representing those SNPs that were or were not associated with disease (Fig. 2 and Online Methods). On the basis of the posterior probabilities from this analysis, an estimated 92% of loci (n = 9,815) were associated with breast cancer risk (95% CI = 85-100%), and these contributed approximately 18% of the familial risk of breast cancer. It should be noted, however, that the large majority of the loci had very small individual effects on risk: for example, the estimated OR was >1.05 for only 10 loci, and 920 loci had an estimated OR of >1.02. When taking into account effects from the previously known loci, these analyses suggest that ~28% of familial risk is explained by common variants selected for iCOGS, of which ~14% can be explained by the 67 established loci (with a further ~20% due to higher penetrance loci).", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 21940, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "DISCUSSION", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 21951, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "To our knowledge, this is the largest genetic association study in cancer so far. The power of this approach is demonstrated by the fact that we have found evidence, at genome-wide levels of significance, for more than 40 new susceptibility loci, more than doubling the number of susceptibility loci for breast cancer. The effect sizes of the newly identified loci are generally modest (the highest OR was 1.26). However, the very high levels of statistical significance, the lack of heterogeneity among studies, the generally higher effect sizes for familial cases and the fact that most of the excess of significant associations was concentrated among SNPs selected on the basis of an association in the combined breast cancer GWAS all indicate that these are robust associations. Although the majority of the data are from populations of Northern and Western European ancestry, there was little or no evidence of heterogeneity in the OR estimates between studies, indicating that the associations apply broadly to populations of European ancestry. With more than 60 established breast cancer susceptibility loci, it is becoming possible to discern some more general patterns among the loci. Although most of the underlying genes and variants remain to be identified, there is a clear excess of genes either known to be involved in tumorigenesis in model systems or involved in processes relevant to cancer, such as cell death and differentiation. However, for other loci, such as PEX14, there is no obvious link to cancer susceptibility. Nine of the new loci lie in chromosomal regions with no known genes, suggesting that these may provide further examples of long-range regulation similar to that seen in the 8q24 region. We have identified three additional examples of loci in the vicinity of susceptibility loci for other cancers (TET2, 8q24 and DNAJC1).

However, the large excess of significant associations among the SNPs selected from the GWAS suggests that many more susceptibility loci exist that have not met our threshold for genome-wide-significant association in this study and that these explain a similar fraction of the heritability as the currently known loci. The observation, made by comparing effect sizes in the iCOGS stage with those in the GWAS, that a very large number of loci, perhaps several thousand, contribute to polygenic susceptibility to breast cancer is consistent with results from GWAS in other complex disorders such as schizophrenia, using a different analytical approach. Incorporating these loci into risk models should substantially improve disease prediction, even if not all loci can be identified individually. Moreover, fine-scale mapping of the identified regions may uncover more of the missing heritability, either through identifying a more strongly associated variant (as found for the CCND1 locus; see French et al.) or by identifying additional signals (exemplified for the TERT region in Bojesen et al.).

To prevent spurious associations due to confounding by nearby eQTLs, we corrected the model for the most strongly associated eQTL SNP in the region. For the tumor analysis only, we also added the copy number of the candidate gene as a covariate because apparent associations between germline genotype and tumor expression may be confounded or obscured by somatic copy number alterations.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 38335, "infons": {"section_type": "METHODS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "To assess the potential effects of the new SNPs on nearby gene expression in lymphocytes, we identified all genes that lie within a 500-kb window surrounding each of the SNPs and used Genevar (Gene Expression Variation), a public database with gene expression data quantified in lymphocytes from individuals in the HapMap 2 populations.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 38672, "infons": {"section_type": "METHODS", "type": "title_2"}, "text": "Estimation of the number of associated loci", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 38716, "infons": {"section_type": "METHODS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "To estimate the total number of newly associated loci selected for the iCOGS array, we first used the set of 29,807 SNPs selected from the GWAS and not selected for fine mapping, to exclude previously known loci. We then defined a set of 10,668 SNPs that were uncorrelated (r2 < 0.1 between any pair) and determined the number of loci for which the estimated effect size in the iCOGS stage was in the same direction as in the combined GWAS and the number of loci for which the effect was in the opposite direction. Similar results were obtained using cutoffs of r2 < 0.05 and r2 < 0.2. On the assumption that none of the loci with effects in opposite directions in the two stages were associated with disease, the number of loci associated with disease can be estimated as the difference between the number of loci with effects in the same direction and the number with effects in opposite directions. This, however, is an underestimate because loci with weak effects may have estimated effects in opposite directions in the two stages. To allow for this possibility, we fitted the distribution of z scores as a mixture of a standard normal distribution (representing SNPs with no effect) and a normal distribution with unknown mean and variance, using an expectation-maximization algorithm. The total contribution to heritability was then computed from the posterior estimates. To allow for the potential effect of residual population stratification, we conducted an additional analysis in which the null distribution was assumed to have variance of 1.2, based on the estimated inflation from the non-BCAC SNPs, but the estimates were essentially identical.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 40375, "infons": {"section_type": "SUPPL", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "Supplementary Material", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 40398, "infons": {"section_type": "SUPPL", "type": "footnote"}, "text": "Note: Supplementary information is available in the online version of the paper.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 40479, "infons": {"section_type": "SUPPL", "type": "footnote"}, "text": "           COMPETING FINANCIAL INTERESTS         ", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 40529, "infons": {"section_type": "SUPPL", "type": "footnote"}, "text": "The authors declare no competing financial interests.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 40583, "infons": {"section_type": "SUPPL", "type": "footnote"}, "text": "Reprints and permissions information is available online at http://www.nature.com/reprints/index.html.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 40686, "infons": {"section_type": "SUPPL", "type": "footnote"}, "text": "           AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS         ", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 40727, "infons": {"section_type": "SUPPL", "type": "footnote"}, "text": "K.
