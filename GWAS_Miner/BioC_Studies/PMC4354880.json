Through a series of enzymatic reactions, the liver-derived protein angiotensinogen is transformed into angiotensin I (this conversion is catalyzed by renin) and subsequently into angiotensin II, which is the key effector of the RAAS, mediating multiple biological effects in the kidneys, the heart and the vasculature through its local and systemic effects. Angiotensin II is a potent vasoconstrictor and adversely impacts cardiac and vascular remodeling.  On a parallel note, angiotensin II stimulates the production of aldosterone in the adrenal glands, which enhances sodium and water reabsorption in the kidneys. Thus, the RAAS is a major determinant of fluid and electrolyte hemostasis, blood pressure (BP) regulation and cardiovascular remodeling. Consequently, RAAS activity influences the development and progression of cardiovascular disease, and pharmacological inhibition of the RAAS has been shown to improve patient outcomes in a variety of clinical settings.

In other words, the ACE affects the concentrations of key effectors of the RAAS (i.e. angiotensin II) and the kallikrein-kinin system, (i.e. bradykinin) in opposite directions.

The AT1 receptor and the bradykinin 2 receptor have been shown to physically interact by forming heterodimers, and this heterodimerization affects downstream signaling.

As reviewed in detail by Kim et al., the Galphas/cAMP/PKA pathway plays a central role in the regulation of renin secretion, one of the key biomarkers of the RAAS. Mice with targeted deletion of Galphas in juxtaglomerular cells display lower basal renin secretion and expression and a blunted response to chronic ACE inhibition or AT1 receptor blockade (impaired \"feedback loop\"), indicating that Galphas signaling is highly relevant to renin secretion and expression under steady-state and dynamic conditions.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 27894, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Co-administration of ACE inhibitors or AT1 antagonists with inhibitors of the adenylate cyclase likewise substantially reduces renin expression as compared to ACE-inhibitors or AT1 antagonists alone.

Additional strengths include the considerable samples size, the careful phenotyping and genotyping in the contributing cohorts as well as their population-based character. As an apparent limitation, plasma renin activity was measured in only two cohorts (total n=5,275) of the discovery sample, and not in the replication sample. Therefore, the genome-wide significant hits for plasma renin activity from the discovery sample had to be tested for association with plasma renin concentrations and circulating aldosterone levels in the replication sample. However, in the absence of large changes in plasma angiotensinogen, measurements of plasma renin activity and concentration investigate the same biomarker, circulating \"active\" renin, almost exclusively of renal origin, and both biomarkers (renin concentration and renin activity) are strongly correlated. In population studies, the control of the physiological factors which influence plasma renin, mainly posture and sodium intake, are less well controlled than in metabolic studies, and this may lead to an underestimation of the genetic association. However, we do not expect major changes in angiotensinogen in an epidemiological setting. Furthermore, since these three biomarkers are tightly inter related and part of the same pathway, the key finding of our investigation, that genetic variation in the kallikrein-kinin systems is associated with RAAS biomarker levels, is supported by the replication analyses. As an additional limitation, the top SNPs associated with plasma renin activity in the discovery cohorts were associated with circulating renin concentrations and aldosterone levels in an independent sample (PREVEND) but not in the individual discovery cohorts themselves.
