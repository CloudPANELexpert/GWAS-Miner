The project offers several scientific advances. Foremost, harmonized data across three independent samples reduces the risk of study-specific artifacts, facilitating the search for cross-validated, replicated signals. Second, longitudinal data offer multiple statistical and substantive benefits. Most fundamentally, statistical models of individual development are unidentifiable without multiple assessments per subject. Thus, GEDI's structure allows genome-wide investigation of genetic risk for longitudinal patterns of alcohol abuse across its principle risk period:adolescence and young adulthood. Next, and crucially, when measuring any outcome with nontrivial measurement error (e.g., alcohol consumption), increasing the number of assessments/subject monotonically increases estimate precision, and consequently statistical power, with dramatic gains when assessments/subject are numerous, as in GEDI. Modeling all GEDI alcohol consumption assessments (>5 per subject) increases estimate precision >3-fold compared to using only first and last assessments.

While psychiatric genetics has made advances toward elucidating the link between genetic variation and alcohol involvement, this research has largely been atemporal. The weakness of such static perspectives on the genetic determinants of alcohol involvement is highlighted not only by developmental perspectives, but also by research within genetics showing that epigenetic mechanisms (i.e., methylation, histone modification and chromatin remodeling) regulate gene expression in response to developmental and environmental cues. Using the GEDI GWAS samples, this longitudinal GWAS meta-analysis has addressed the issue of developmental variation in genetic influences across adolescence and young adulthood through genome-wide testing of common variant effects on longitudinal measures of alcohol consumption, employing FDR methods to control the risk of false discoveries.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 26436, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Our top genome-wide finding involved three SNPs (rs7031417, rs17053864, rs7019589) at pseudogene LOC100129340 (mitofusin-1-like). Very little is known regarding this pseudogene, which was only added in the most recent, hg19, gene track (thus, its absence in the regional plot). However, variants within LOC100129340 were found to be associated with adult human height in a large GWAS meta-analysis. Also, one of the genome-wide significant hits fell within exon 4 of the pseudogene. Given that pseudogenes, by definition, lack protein-coding function, the prior probability of this locus being a true discovery is somewhat diminished. However, considering: a) the association signal is in a transcribed sequence, b) pseudogene transcripts have demonstrated trans-regulation of homologous coding genes and c) endogenous siRNA are sometimes derived from pseudogene transcription, it would be rash to dismiss this result as a false discovery.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 27376, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Our second genome-wide significant locus was tagged by rs11710497, located within GABA transporter 1:SLC6A1 (solute carrier family 6 (neurotransmitter transporter, GABA), member 1). Given that alcohol functions primarily through binding to GABA receptors, and that this gene encodes protein GAT-1, which removes GABA from the synaptic cleft, there is a notably high prior probability of this being a true discovery. Furthermore, while the two genome-wide significant/suggestive hits were in intronic regions, they tag strongly associated exonic variants in SLC6A1. Although the network biology of the gene suggests obvious links to alcohol consumption, there has been surprisingly little research studying this relationship. Conversely, studies have implicated the gene in anxiety disorders and ADHD (e.g.,). This finding should focus future research on the study of SLC6A1 variants in alcohol abuse and other psychiatric phenotypes related to cortical excitability/inhibition.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 28356, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The strong association of a large region near ADRA2A (adrenoceptor alpha 2A) also provides a promising potential biological mechanism. Alpha-2-adrenergic receptors are members of the G protein-coupled receptor superfamily. These receptors have a critical role in regulating neurotransmitter release from sympathetic nerves and from adrenergic neurons in the CNS. Alpha2A and alpha2C subtypes are required for normal presynaptic control of transmitter release from sympathetic nerves in central noradrenergic neurons, and the alpha2A subtype inhibits transmitter release at high neural stimulation frequencies. This gene encodes alpha2A subtype and it contains no introns in either its coding or untranslated sequences. There is an extensive literature on the gene and many findings suggesting association to ADHD (e.g.,), as well as metabolic traits (e.g., glycemic phenotypes, blood pressure) (for meta-analysis see) and substance abuse. Given the neurobiological implications, this gene should be considered a strong candidate in future alcohol abuse studies. The final three genome-wide suggestive (q<0.2) loci were for intronic SNPs in ZNF578, MIPOL1 and IGSF9B and have no reported evidence linking them to alcohol use/abuse phenotypes.

Given that GABA and glutamate neurotransmitter systems are primary pharmacodynamic targets of alcohol (for review see), these results are consistent with extant knowledge of the drug's biological mechanisms. \"Celecoxib pharmacodynamics\" and \"nuclear hormone receptors\" also offer intriguing biological mechanisms for genetic variation in alcohol metabolism. Celecoxib acts by inhibiting prostaglandin synthesis. Prostaglandins are lipid autocrine/paracrine mediators with a variety of physiological effects, including inflammation modulation, which have been shown to moderate alcohol \"hangover\" intensity and reduce alcohol-induced liver toxicity. \"Nuclear hormone receptors\" (NHR) are intracellular proteins responsible for sensing steroid and thyroid hormones and some other signaling molecules.

While G-protein signaling is involved in many biological processes, it is known that alcohol intoxication is directly connected to the actions of four G-protein gated inwardly-rectifying potassium (GIRK) channel subunits, one of which was among the genes implicated in this pathway analysis (i.e., KCNJ3).
