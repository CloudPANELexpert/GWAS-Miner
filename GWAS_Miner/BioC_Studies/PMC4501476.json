Metrics used for identifying poorly or incorrectly clustered data included intensity, cluster separation, position of each cluster (AA, AB, BB), Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, call frequency and variation of cluster width. The reproducibility of control samples on each plate as well as replicates were also used to identify misclustered loci. Although not all cluster plots were assessed, ~10% of the lowest performing loci were examined. Of these 10%, ~20% were edited or annotated (to indicate loci with nearby polymorphisms or hemizygous deletions) and ~2% were excluded.
