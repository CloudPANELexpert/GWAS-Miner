Both studies accounted for differences in heart rate using Bazett's formula which is explicitly discouraged in current guidelines for ECG interpretation and can under or overcorrect the influence of heart rate on QT interval. A previous study from the WHI adjusting for heart rate using linear regression did not observe differences in QT interval by self-reported ancestry. Our study has some advantages over these previous studies. First, our derivation of ancestry from genome-wide genetic data reduced bias resulting from the ambiguity of self-reported ancestry and allowed treatment of ancestry as a continuous variable. Second, our use of multiple population-based cohorts reduced bias resulting from ethnic differences in access and utilization of health care and allowed consistency in methodology used for ascertainment and measurement of QT interval. Third, our meta-analysis of several large cohorts allowed adequate power to detect strong or modest ancestral effects. Fourth, our use of continuous ECG measurements of QT and RR intervals allowed adjustment for heart rate using regression modelling techniques, which are well known to be more stable across the entire range of QT interval than Bazett's formula. Thus, our findings from several large population cohorts that QT interval adjusted for major covariates is not associated with the proportion of African ancestry based on whole-genome SNP suggests that observations in the two previous studies might reflect chance, selection bias, measurement bias or other confounding influences that contribute to between race comparisons rather than within-race proportion genetic ancestry analyses.

In addition, this could also reflect the modest power to detect common variant associations of weak effect. The current study is similar in size to the QTGEN and QTSCD studies and it is perhaps not unexpected that different equally powered studies will identify different common variants when multiple variants exist at a locus, as has now been observed in many large-scale genetic association studies. Additional studies are needed to identify the causal variants and genes.

This limitation is likely to be of small impact, as participants of most cohorts were in the early middle age. Third, we did not have information on several clinical factors that are known to influence QT interval, including concurrent medications, myocardial ischemia, heart failure and timepoint on the day of ECG recording which potentially explain a large proportion of QT variation. Although such factors are unlikely to be determined by genotypic effects and thus unlikely to bias our observations, they could potentially dilute the effect of genetic associations.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 23445, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "In conclusion, our results establish that QT interval does not differ substantially by ancestry and extended the association of genetic polymorphisms at several loci including NOS1AP and ATP1B1 to populations of African ancestry.

However, it remains unknown whether such differences result from differences in inherited myocardial electrophysiological properties. Previous studies have shown inconsistent results regarding ethnic differences in electrocardiographic QT interval, a measure of myocardial repolarization time and a central pathophysiological determinant of arrhythmia known to have a strong genetic component. In the present study, we therefore studied whether African compared to European ancestry inferred from genome-wide genotype data was associated with QT interval in 12 000 African Americans from seven population-based studies. We observed no difference in duration of QT interval with African compared to European ancestry, arguing against important differences in myocardial repolarization time across these ethnicities. We also performed a genome-wide association study to identify common genetic variants associated with electrocardiographic QT interval in 13 000 African Americans from ten cohorts, and observed association with QT interval for several loci previously identified as genetic determinants of QT interval in individuals of European ancestry, including SNPs at genetic loci harboring the genes NOS1AP, ATP1B1, KCNQ1, KCNH2, LITAF and PLN.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}], "annotations": [], "relations": []}]}
