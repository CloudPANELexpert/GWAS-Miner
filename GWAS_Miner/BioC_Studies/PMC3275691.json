At baseline, 15% of all participants had triglyceride levels exceeding 150 mg/dL, 67% had high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels lower than 50 mg/dL, 14% had low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels higher than 150 mg/dL, and 31% had total cholesterol levels exceeding 200 mg/dL, indicating relatively low prevalence of dyslipidemia in the study population. Serum concentrations of all inflammatory biomarkers except hsCRP slightly increased from baseline to post-fenofibrate treatment, while dyslipidemia improved, as evidenced by decreases in triglycerides, low density lipoprotein- and total cholesterol, and a small increase in high density lipoprotein cholesterol.

The top two loci for the hsCRP-IL6 pattern before fenofibrate, both of which reached the genome-wide significance level, were in or within 20 kb of the IL2RA (interleukin 2 receptor-alpha) gene. One of the two IL2RA SNPs (rs12722605) was also the locus that associated most significantly with the MCP1-TNF-alpha pattern after fenofibrate.

The rs6517147 marker is located on chromosome 21 within 100 kb of the IFNAR2 (interferon receptor 2) and within 150 kb of the IL10RB (interleukin 10 receptor beta) genes; it has a minor allele frequency of 0.20 in the HapMap European (CEU) population. Despite not reaching genome-wide statistical significance, this finding is of biological relevance, as evidence from animal and human studies supports the role of both genes in the systemic inflammatory response. Specifically, IFNAR-knockout mice were shown to exhibit decreased resistance to inflammation-induced apoptotic stressors and impaired replenishment by precursors following infection with Pneumocystis.

The association with rs12722605 also approached statistical significance post-fenofibrate treatment for the MCP1-TNF-alpha pattern. These results are consistent with previously published reports that have linked this region of chromosome 10 to a variety of immunologically relevant phenotypes including response to seasonal influenza vaccine, Graves' disease, and type 1 diabetes. Additionally, rs12722605 was found to be borderline associated with susceptibility to multiple sclerosis. The IL2R-alpha/CD25 subunit encoded by the IL2RA gene is a component of the interleukin 2 receptor involved in control of T-cell response and autoimmunity.

The CYP4F8 gene encodes a member of the arachidonic acid pathway that affects inflammation by oxygenating and hydroxylating COX-derived products to prostaglandin E2.

Collagen type XIII-alpha1, encoded by the COL13A1 gene, has been previously linked to inflammation in the liver and intestine.

First, as this is the first genome-wide study of inflammatory response to PPAR-alpha agonist treatment, the findings need to be replicated in independent cohorts to provide evidence of validity. However, due to the uniqueness of the GOLDN intervention and the limited availability of information on inflammatory phenotypes in other clinical trials, replication presents a serious challenge common to pharmacogenomics. Second, because the magnitude of effect of each marker on the complex phenotype of inflammatory response is likely to be small, our sample size may not have been sufficient to identify all relevant loci. Third, the use of principal component analyses to identify patterns from individual inflammatory biomarkers may not fully capture the state of systemic inflammation and does not provide an intuitive interpretation of regression coefficients from the final models. However, prior work from our group showed that individuals with higher scores on either pattern also had higher concentrations of the biomarkers with high factor loadings (i.e. hsCRP and IL6 or MCP1 and TNF-alpha), suggesting that the pattern scores have a distinct biological meaning. Fourth, as our study population is a priori at lower risk for cardiovascular disease than those with a true indication for fenofibrate, the generalizability of our findings may be limited.
