Beyond its well established role in musculo-skeletal health, accumulating evidence suggests that vitamin D plays a crucial role in diverse physiological functions which include several commoncancers, cardiovascular disease, autoimmune diseases (e.g., type 1 diabetes (T1D), multiple sclerosis, Crohn's disease and rheumatoid arthritis), Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's disease. Clinical vitamin D deficiency causes rickets in children and osteomalacia in children and adults. Overwhelming evidence suggests that decreased vitamin D levels associate with increased age-related disorders including the development, progression, and severity of T2D.

In 2012, we reported a strong association of serum 25(OH)D deficiency with T2D and obesity in 1765 Asian Indian participants enrolled in our Asian Indian diabetic heart study/Sikh diabetes study (AIDHS/SDS). A significantly higher percentage of T2D patients (83%) were vitamin D deficient compared to normoglycemic individuals (68%). Similarly, a significant linear increase (p <0.0001) in the frequency of vitamin D deficient individuals was observed (65.2%, 75.5%, 81.4%) as the BMI (kg/m2) increased (<23, 23-27.5, >27.5), respectively. There is accumulating evidence to support that variation in serum vitamin D levels, including deficiency, is under strong genetic control. Results of family and twin studies suggest evidence for genetic influences on vitamin D metabolism and their association with a wide range of chronic complex diseases. 25(OH)D, the most abundant circulating metabolite, is the best indicator of vitamin D status and has a high heritability ranging from 28-80%. Recent in vitro evidence also suggests that vitamin D modulates the expression of hundreds of genes, many of which belong to disease-associated pathways. The global distribution of vitamin D receptors in the body controls nearly 3000 genes, which may have widespread health implications. However, the molecular mechanism by which vitamin D exerts its effects in diverse diseases remains incompletely understood. So far only a handful of Genome Wide Association Studies (GWAS) have been performed to identify genetic determinants of circulating 25(OH)D levels.

Studies suggest the presence of calcium and vitamin D response elements(VDRE) in the IVL promoter play an important role in mediating the action of 25(OH)D on IVL expression. Future sequencing, and functional studies will provide further insight on the discovery of putative functional variants in IVL, and how these may impact binding of VDRE or how calcium response elements regulate the induction of IVL in keratinocytes.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 24797, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "In addition to identifying novel loci associated with vitamin D concentrations in Sikhs, our study confirmed 3 of 5 previously identified GWAS loci, validating our vitamin D measures and at least partial overlap of causal vitamin D loci between European, Hispanic and Sikh populations. The reason for the non-replication of the two other previously known GWAS regions in this study could be the differences in linkage disequilibrium between marker and causal SNPs between the populations, though, the allele frequencies in Sikhs did not vary significantly with respect to Caucasians(Supplementary Table 4). Of note, our study did not detect any association between VDR gene variants and 25(OH)D concentrations in this population. Genetic polymorphisms in the VDR gene (BsmI, FokI, ApaI, and TaqI) have been extensively studied for assessing VDR-disease association in multiple conditions, and results have been conflicting across studies. Recent meta-analyses studies suggest association between VDR variants with cancer, Fractures, tuberculosis, and rheumatoid arthritis. However, contrarily to expectations, SNPs in VDR have not been associated with 25(OH)D concentrations in most GWA studies. Even a large meta-analysis study by Wang et al., could not identify the association of VDR locus with 25(OH)D concentrations.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 26119, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Strengths of our study include the use of a well-characterized, relatively homogenous population with high predisposition to diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Both discovery and replication data sets are from one geographic location from the Punjab province of India. We also minimized inter-study variability of discovery and replication cohort by measuring 25(0H)D levels using immunoassay kit from one source and using one instrument. None of our study subjects were on vitamin supplementation which adds further strength to the study. We understand that the lack of availability of seasonal data to adjust seasonal changes which may influence vitamin D concentrations, is a limitation in our study. However, literature suggests that people living above 35 N and below 35 S latitude do not receive adequate UV radiations in the winter months to produce adequate vitamin D in these months. Conversely, India is below 35 N and has tropical climate with availability of sunlight through most part of the year would make Indian people to be less affected by seasonal variation. The other limitation includes our relatively small sample size (n = 3538). Despite the lack of sufficient power for capturing small effect sizes for the loci discovered in a large study exceeding 33,000 individuals from the SUNLIGHT consortium, our study was able to replicate variants in 3 of 5 known genes including GC (DBP) and CYP2R1 reported in Europeans and the DAB1 reported in Hispanics with a much smaller sample size.
