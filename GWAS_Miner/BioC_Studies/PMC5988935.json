The newly discovered locus on chromosome 8 is at the 5' end of the SLC25A37 gene which encodes an iron carrier localized in the mitochondrial inner membrane adding further support for a mitochondrial role in major depression. Second, we found evidence for interaction between adversity and genotype at all three loci. Third, we provide modest evidence for heterogeneity at the whole-genome level: i) 13.2% of the variance in major depression liability arises from interaction between genome-wide SNP effects and adversity, ii) genetic correlation for major depression between subgroups with and without adversity exposure was +0.64, and iii) although confidence intervals overlapped, SNP-based heritability estimates of major depression in the unexposed subgroup was higher (~39%) than the overall sample (30%). Furthermore, simulations reflecting etiologic heterogeneity are consistent with our results.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 23270, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "These results have several implications. First, they provide support for long-debated typology that major depression patients can be meaningfully divided into those whose illness arises in reaction to environmental stressors and those whose disorder emerges \"from within\". The genetic substrates of these two forms of major depression appear to be correlated but not identical, and some genetic factors may have subtype specific effects.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 23712, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Second, these findings provide insight into how effects of genes and environment combine to give rise to major depression. A leading hypothesis consistent with prior studies is that certain genes have a stronger impact on risk for major depression in adversity-exposed than unexposed individuals. We unexpectedly find, that for three loci, an opposite pattern in which effects were stronger in cases without adversity exposure. While the CONVERGE sample may contain loci with an increased impact on adversity-exposed individuals, power to detect these is low as only 27% of our sample reported severe adversity.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 24324, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "An appealing interpretation of our findings is that absent environmental stressors, a higher genetic loading is required to cause depression. This cannot, however, explain our findings as it would predict a graded response at the three identified loci in exposed and unexposed individuals. Rather, our results suggest at least two classes of molecular variants that predispose to major depression: those whose effects are present in all cases and those whose effects depend on the history of adversity. In contrast to the three SNPs discovered by stratifying on adversity, results for the two previously reported SNPs on chromosome 10 are consistent with a liability threshold model. Major depression may be a syndrome arising from several partially distinct etiologies. The design of CONVERGE enabled the combination of \"deep\" phenotypes and genotypes to detect differences in the genetic architecture of those with and without adversity.

Third, our assessments of age at onset of depression and adversity exposure were retrospective. Although interviewers encouraged effortful responding, we cannot rule out recall biases.
