Although we did not identify any genome-wide significant findings, the study had several limitations that should be considered. One limitation is the loss of power inherent in the analysis of sub-phenotypes. By examining sub-phenotypes of BP, we focused on a portion of our total sample in each analysis, decreasing the power to detect associations. We hoped to overcome this limitation by combining the data from three large GWAS. As a result, our analysis of sub-phenotypes in BP is the largest to date. However, the power of the combined sample may still not have been sufficient. We estimated that the combined sample had 80% power to detect loci of genome-wide significance with a mean difference of 1.8 years for age at onset and an odds ratio of 1.6 for psychotic symptoms. By focusing on certain sub-phenotypes we sought to identify more homogeneous sub-groups of patients in which loci of such effect sizes might operate. However, our results do not support this hypothesis in relation to age at onset or psychotic symptoms in BP. It may be these sub-phenotypes are no less genetically complex than BP and that larger sample sizes of the sort being assembled by the PGC are needed to identify relevant loci. For example, we estimated that a sample of 15,775 BP cases with psychosis and 6,752 without psychosis would be needed to detect a genome-wide significant association with 80% power at an odds ratio of 1.15. It is also possible there are loci of larger effect sizes influencing these sub-phenotypes, but they are of low frequency and as a result are not adequately captured by the genotyping panels currently used in GWAS. We imputed to the HapMap phase I & II panel, which is estimated to cover 94% of the genome (2005). Thus, there could also be common loci influencing the sub-phenotypes that were not captured in our study.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 19067, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Another limitation of this study is the possibility of measurement error in the sub-phenotypes. Previous studies have suggested that age at onset and psychotic symptoms can be measured reliably. One study showed that the intraclass correlation varied between 0.68 and 0.97 for different measures of age at onset, and another study showed that the rater agreement for diagnosing hallucinations and delusions yielded a coefficient of reliability of 0.91. However, to the extent that these sub-phenotypes are measured with error, results will likely be biased towards the null. Related to this is the fact that the samples used different diagnostic instruments to measure these sub-phenotypes. While the GAIN-BP and BiGS studies used the DIGS, the German sample used the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID). Such differences may introduce error into the characterization of the sub-phenotypes across the samples, despite our efforts to harmonize their definitions. Indeed, we observed significant differences in the ages at onset and rates of psychotic symptoms in the German sample compared to GAIN-BP and BiGS. The observed differences may reflect sampling variation, differences in the measurement of the sub-phenotypes, or true differences in the patient populations across the samples. Future work aimed at matching the definition and clinical assessment of sub-phenotypes across studies may facilitate efforts to examine genotype-phenotype correlations. In addition, alternative approaches to defining the clinical sub-phenotypes, such as using admixture analysis to define the boundaries of age at onset classes(;;), may provide further insights. Finally, we only assessed two sub-phenotypes in this study.
