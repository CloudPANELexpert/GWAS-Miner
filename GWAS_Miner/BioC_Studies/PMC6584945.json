The HumanOmniExpress interrogates 730 525 individual SNPs per sample, while the Omnil-Quad BeadChip interrogates 1 011 219 individual SNPs. Genotypes were called using Illumina's GENOMESTUDIO software. PLINK was utilized to perform quality control (QC) analyses on the genetic data from each chip separately and then after the data from each chip was combined (Supporting Information Fig. S1). For each chip, we first removed individuals with greater than 5 percent missing data. We further identified and removed related individuals by using PLINK to estimate the proportion of identity by descent (IBD) for each pair of individuals. Among pairs of individuals with an IBD proportion >0.12 (indicating cousins or a closer relation), we removed the individual in each pair with the higher rate of missing genotype data. We restricted SNPs to autosomes, those with greater than a 95 percent call rate, a frequency of less than 0.01 and Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) P-value < 1 x 10-5. We next performed principal component analysis (PCA) to infer axes of genetic ancestry. Prior to PCA, we used PLINK to prune the data in windows of 50 base pairs, removing one SNP from each pair of SNPs with r2 > 0.05 to obtain a set of roughly independent SNPs. Based on PCA, we retained those individuals who fell within three standard deviations of the medians of the first and second principal components of self-reported African Americans in order to minimize genetic differences due to genetic ancestry.

A total of 21,394 transcripts were on both the v3.0 and v4.0 arrays and were significantly expressed above background levels (detection P < 0.05) in at least 10 percent of subjects and were thus eligible for further analysis. Briefly, raw microarray scan files from Illumina HT-12 v3.0 arrays were exported using the Illumina BEADSTUDIO program and loaded into R for downstream analysis (www.R-pro-ject.org).

Three prior studies were conducted with general population samples and reported ks of 0.70, 0.86, and 0.89, respectively, at the standard AUDIT cut-point of 8. Together, such data suggest that while a variety of cut-points may be used, an AUDIT score of 8 is generally considered a good marker of risk.

Previously published variants conferring risk for heavy alcohol consumption and/or AD were not associated with AUDIT scores in the GTP cohort. We hypothesize that this lack of replication is due to several aspects of the GTP population and study design. Given the known heterogeneity of genetic influences on typical alcohol use, risk drinking and AD, it is likely that different risk variants may influence maximum drinks consumed in a 24-hour period, AD diagnoses and AUDIT scores for example. In addition, the characteristics of the GTP study population differ in several ways from previous studies of alcohol use behavior and problems including genetic ancestry, patterns of substance use, demographic characteristics and relatively high levels of trauma exposure, PTSD and depression co-morbidity.

Sodium channel activity, particularly Na(v)1.8, has been associated with the neuronal effects of ethanol exposure and linked to alcohol use behavior.

One particularly salient control function is the ability to refrain from maladaptive, but inherently rewarding behaviors, such as excessive alcohol consumption.

Such replications represent an important next step in understanding these findings. Third, the present analysis uses data available at a single timepoint, using retrospective reports of alcohol use behavior. Previous studies have found that individuals typically underreport their drinking consumption (e.g.), which would likely diminish the association effects observed in this study.
