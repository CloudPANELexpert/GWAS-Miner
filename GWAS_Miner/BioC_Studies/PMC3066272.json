Myosin is a hexamer consisting of two heavy chain subunits (alpha and beta), two light chain subunits and two regulatory subunits. MYH6 encodes the alpha myosin heavy chain subunit (alphaMHC) that encompasses ~26,000 bp and consists of 39 exons, 37 of which contain coding information (Supplementary Fig. 4). The beta myosin heavy chain subunit (betaMHC), a relatively slow ATPase encoded by MYH7, is the heavy chain isoform predominantly expressed in human heart, with expression of alphaMHC, a fast ATPase, being primarily restricted to atrial tissue. The two genes (MYH6 and MYH7) are in a head-to-tail orientation on chromosome 14 and are regulated in an antithecal manner. In heart failure and other cardiac disorders in humans, betaMHC is upregulated whereas alphaMHC is downregulated, resulting in diminution of cardiac performance, and it has been suggested that even minor shifts in the MHC composition of the cardiac muscle can markedly influence cardiac function.

Based on PolyPhen, the p.Arg721Trp alteration is predicted to alter the structure of the converter. Whether and how this structural alteration may directly affect cardiac conduction is pending further structure-function analysis of the protein. Further, although the alphaMHC itself has not been directly linked to cardiac conduction, a cardiac-specific highly conserved microRNA, miR-208a, encoded by intron 27 of MYH6 in both humans and mice, has recently been shown in mice to be necessary for maintenance of normal cardiac conduction. Evidence suggests that miR-208a is required for expression of Gja5 (also known as Cx40), which is of particular interest as mice lacking Gja5 show cardiac conduction abnormalities, including both sinus node impulse formation and atrial propagation. Thus, another potential functional consequence of the p.Arg721Trp alteration could be an effect on alphaMHC mRNA stability or processing, as previously documented for both synonymous and non-synonymous coding mutations, which would directly affect the amount of miR-208a present in the heart.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 16209, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "In summary, we have discovered a rare variant in a previously unidentified SSS susceptibility gene that confers high risk of the disease.
