Cytochrome P450 2A6 (CYP2A6) metabolizes up to 70% of nicotine into cotinine via C-oxidation. Cotinine is further metabolized to trans-3'-hydroxycotinine (3HCOT) primarily by the same enzyme. 3HCOT is further metabolized by glucuronidation, and quantifying the sum of 3HCOT and its glucuronide conjugate, referred to as \"total 3HCOT\", captures the total conversion of cotinine to 3HCOT. The ratio of total 3HCOT to COT has traditionally been used to assess CYP2A6 activity. Differences in the rate of nicotine metabolism have been shown to contribute to inter-individual variation in smoking behavior and, consequently, lung cancer risk. In order to achieve the desired psycho-pharmacological effects of nicotine, smokers have been shown to adjust their cigarette consumption to maintain stable levels of nicotine in the circulation. A slower nicotine metabolism rate causes the individual to smoke less extensively (i.e., smoke fewer cigarettes per day and/or extract lower nicotine dose per cigarette) to reach the same plasma nicotine level as an individual who metabolizes nicotine more rapidly (Figure 1). Smoking less extensively results in a lower exposure to tobacco smoke-derived carcinogens and, hence, likely to a lower risk of developing lung cancer.

The smallest p-value was 0.039 after adjustment for smoking status and pack-years, although for squamous cell carcinoma the lowest p-value was smaller (0.006). We interpret this, like similar data showing that smokers with the CHRNA5 variant uptake more nicotine and carcinogens per cigarette, as suggesting that, in epidemiological studies, residual confounding by the effect of smoking remains when adjusting lung cancer risk estimates for cigarettes per day or pack-years. Accordingly, markers of CYP2A6 activity may be useful, along with CHRNA5 genotype, in predicting risk of lung cancer among smokers, over and beyond the exposure information captured through standard smoking history.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 24697, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "We are the first to show with GWAS data that this region is associated with risk of lung cancer, due evidently to its influence on nicotine metabolism as measured by the CYP2A6 activity ratio. CYP2A6 is a member of the cytochrome P450 super family involved in the metabolism of xenobiotics. It is the primary metabolizing enzyme for nicotine and it has been found to metabolize 70% of nicotine into cotinine via C-oxidation. Genetic variants in this gene may influence lung cancer risk by modifying nicotine metabolism, and therefore smoking behavior with specific alleles either increasing or decreasing smoking dose and exposure to tobacco lung carcinogens (Figure 1). However, it should be noted that CYP2A6 variants may also affect bioactivation of the tobacco specific lung carcinogen, 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)1-butanone (NNK). Candidate-gene studies have shown that among Asians, CYP2A6*4, the whole gene deletion, which has been associated with little to no CYP2A6 enzymatic activity, is associated with a decreased risk of lung cancer. In a study in whites, it was found that a genetic risk score including CYP2A6*2, *4, *9, and *12 was weakly associated with an increased lung cancer risk (wild-type metabolizers vs reduced metabolizers-referent) (OR = 1.26, 95% CI = 0.90 to 1.76; P = .180).

When adjusting for each of these imputed functional variants, our top two SNPs (rs5611850 and rs35755165) remained significantly associated with CYP2A6 activity (all p-values remained <5.8x10-8). Among the significant functional variants, rs4803381, previously found to be correlated with various functional CYP2A6 haplotypes, had the greatest influence on our findings with CYP2A6 activity. The level of significance for both top hits rs56113850 and rs35755165 decreased somewhat when conditioning on rs4803381. When performing similar conditional analyses for lung cancer risk in the TRICL data, we found that both rs5611850 and rs35755165 remained strongly statistically significant when conditioning on any of the same four functional variants, with the greatest effects also noted when conditioning on rs4803381.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 27748, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "We were unable to clearly identify a single, or group of, CYP2A6 functional variants that entirely explained our findings.

We note that the high sequence homology across CYP2A6, CYP2A7 and CYP2A13 may result in genotyping misclassification for these variants. Indeed, a comparison between the same SNPs genotyped with TaqMan assays and genotyped on the Illumina commercial array or imputed from data using commercial array data in the MEC smokers data showed only a moderate correlation (r2 range=0.62 to 0.81).

From our data, both CYP2A6 activity and CYP2A6 genotype appear to capture additional exposure information, compared to smoking history. Because of the difficulty in genotyping the high-homology region that includes CYP2A6, CYP2A6 activity is expected to be a stronger risk predictor than CYP2A6 genotype.
