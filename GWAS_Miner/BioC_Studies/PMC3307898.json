Since common neuronal mechanisms may mediate the adaptation to diverse cerebral insults, we hypothesized that susceptibility for age-related cognitive decline may be due in part to a shared genetic network. We have therefore performed a genome-wide association study using a quantitative measure of global cognitive decline slope, based on repeated measures of 17 cognitive tests in 749 subjects from the Religious Orders Study. Top results were evaluated in three independent replication cohorts, consisting of 2,279 additional subjects with repeated cognitive testing. As expected, we find that the Alzheimer's disease (AD) susceptibility locus, APOE, is strongly associated with rate of cognitive decline (PDISC=5.6x10-9; PJOINT=3.7x10-27). We additionally discover a variant, rs10808746, which shows consistent effects in the replication cohorts and modestly improved evidence of association in the joint analysis (PDISC=6.7x10-5; PREP=9.4x10-3; PJOINT=2.3x10-5). This variant influences the expression of two adjacent genes, PDE7A and MTFR1, which are potential regulators of inflammation and oxidative injury, respectively. Using aggregate measures of genetic risk, we find that known susceptibility loci for cardiovascular disease, type II diabetes, and inflammatory diseases are not significantly associated with cognitive decline in our cohort. Our results suggest that intermediate phenotypes, when coupled with larger sample sizes, may be a useful tool to dissect susceptibility loci for age-related cognitive decline and uncover shared molecular pathways with a role in neuronal injury.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 1870, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "INTRODUCTION", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 1883, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Decline in cognitive performance occurs with advancing age and is associated with a variety of common, age-related chronic medical conditions. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent cause of dementia; however, many other common adult illnesses, including type II diabetes, cerebrovascular disease as well as other cardiovascular risk factors, and inflammatory disorders have been implicated in age-related cognitive decline. Based on autopsy series from community-based cohorts, most individuals with dementia have multiple contributory pathologies at the time of death. It is likely that diverse forms of brain injury interact to accelerate cognitive decline. For example, it has been suggested that vascular-related brain injury may promote the development of AD pathology or, less directly, the clinical manifestation of AD-related cognitive decline. Results from a variety of experimental paradigms for the study of neuronal injury and repair indicate that overlapping cellular and molecular mechanisms likely mediate the response to a diversity of central nervous system insults. Besides the local reactions to brain lesions, the ability of neuronal networks to adapt to and compensate for an accumulated burden of injury, sometimes referred to as cognitive reserve, likely has a substantial impact on the trajectory of cognitive decline.

While elucidating the functional impact of disease-associated genetic variants remains an active area of investigation, there is evidence that these genes may have important roles beyond AD pathogenesis in affecting other disorders potentially relevant to cognitive decline. For example, in addition to the well-known effect of the APOE locus in promoting AD risk, this locus has also been associated with dyslipidemia, cardiovascular disease, and increased cerebral infarcts. Similarly, polymorphisms in the CR1 gene, encoding a complement receptor, have previously been associated with susceptibility for infectious disease, particularly malaria.

Based on available databases of gene expression data, such as BioGPS (http://biogps.gnf.org), both PDE7A and MTFR1 are widely expressed in diverse tissue types, including the central nervous system; however, a publically available brain expression dataset with genome-wide genotyping did not include probes for either MTFR1 or PDE7A. We were therefore unable to readily confirm our findings in this tissue context.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 27001, "infons": {"section_type": "RESULTS", "type": "title_2"}, "text": "Aggregate genetic risk profiles for prediction of cognitive decline", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 27069, "infons": {"section_type": "RESULTS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "In addition to a per SNP genome-wide analysis, we pursued a complementary approach taking into account the aggregate effect of multiple validated susceptibility alleles for other diseases. Specifically, we developed 4 separate genetic risk score models incorporating known susceptibility variants for medical conditions known or hypothesized to promote cognitive decline, including AD, cardiovascular disease, type II diabetes, and inflammatory disease. In our ROS discovery cohort, a diagnosis of AD or of type II diabetes mellitus was significantly associated with cognitive decline (Table S5), consistent with prior studies. Table S7 summarizes the SNPs included in each aggregate genetic risk score, along with the relevant references. For both the AD and cardiovascular risk models, we excluded APOE from consideration, since this locus' strong effect on cognitive decline would overwhelm the contribution of loci with more modest effect sizes. As shown in Table 3, none of the aggregate risk models returned evidence of association in our ROS discovery cohort, and only the AD model demonstrated nominal association to cognitive decline in a more powerful joint analysis that included both the ROS and MAP cohorts. Our modest sample size limits our power in these analyses, but validating our strategy, we do see the expected correlation of the aggregate estimate of genetic risk for type II diabetes with a diagnosis of diabetes in our subjects (Table S6).", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 28535, "infons": {"section_type": "RESULTS", "type": "title_2"}, "text": "Power for discovery and replication of genetic variants associated with cognitive decline", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 28625, "infons": {"section_type": "RESULTS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The genetic architecture of cognitive decline is currently not known. Given our results and the size of our discovery and replication sample sets, it is likely that cognitive decline, like most other complex traits, is influenced by many variants of modest effect, in addition to the APOE locus which has a strong effect on this trait. Using the PDE7A/MTFR1 and CR1 loci as putative susceptibility loci with which to calibrate the design of future studies exploring cognitive decline, we performed power calculations to assess the sample size that would be necessary for a robust discovery study. For CR1, we observe an effect size (Beta) of -0.0130 and a minor allele frequency (MAF) of 0.20 in the ROS cohort; thus, we would need 7,241 subjects to observe a genome-wide significant effect on the rate of cognitive decline (P<5x10-8) with 80% power, and 8,288 subjects for 90% power. For PDE7A/MTFR1, the effect size in the ROS cohort (Beta=0.0210) is probably inflated given that this is the discovery cohort for this variant. However, given this magnitude of an effect and a MAF of 0.43, we would need 1,794 subjects to have 80% power to observe a genome-wide significant effect (P<5x10-8), and 2,053 subjects for 90% power. However, in the MAP cohort, the PDE7A/MTFR1 has an effect size of 0.008, yielding an alternative estimate of 12,175 subjects needed for 80% power and 13,937 subjects for 90% power. The latter estimate is likely to more accurately reflect the true effect size of our variant since it comes from a replication cohort. The requirement for a larger sample size is consistent with what has been observed for other human traits and likely explains, at least in part, why we have not yet discovered susceptibility variants for cognitive decline reaching the genome-wide significance level. These estimates will guide the design of our future efforts: it appears that sample sizes between 7,241 and 12,175 subjects will be needed to have reasonable power to assemble convincing evidence of association between genetic variation and the rate of cognitive decline.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 30716, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "DISCUSSION", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 30727, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "We report the results of a genome-wide scan in 749 elder subjects to identify loci associated with the rate of cognitive decline, using a mixed effects model that incorporates repeated cognitive measures. Consistent with numerous prior studies, we found robust evidence for association between the APOE locus and the rate of age-related cognitive decline. Besides APOE, in a replication analysis including 2,279 additional subjects, we identified one other locus (PDE7A/MTFR1) with consistent direction of effect on cognitive decline in all cohorts and improved evidence of association in a joint analysis. While additional replication efforts will be needed to validate the role of this locus in cognitive decline, our replication and extension analyses strongly suggest that this locus has an effect on the rate of cognitive decline in aging individuals.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 31584, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "To begin to understand the function of this variant, we explored its possible role in influencing the expression of nearby genes using available gene expression datasets. Although further work is needed to better understand the effect of this variant in different cell types (particularly in the brain for which data were not available), two of the three genes found in the block of LD surrounding the associated variant - PDE7A and MTFR1 - appear to be influenced by rs10808746, which is found in an intron of PDE7A. MTFR1 has been shown to induce mitochondrial fission in a variety of cell types, and in Mtfr1null mice, testicular cells show increased oxidative injury and reduced expression of free radical scavengers, such as Glutathione Peroxidase 3. Thus, MTFR1 is a reasonable candidate gene for further validation in the context of cognitive decline since it could be involved in modulating the response of CNS cells to oxidative stress, implicated in many different models of neuronal injury including AD, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, and Parkinson's disease. PDE7A is another strong candidate: it is expressed in both neuronal and non-neuronal CNS cells and regulates intracellular signaling by affecting the concentration of cyclic dinucleotides. Data on its possible function in CNS cells is limited, but one report suggests that inhibiting this molecule may contribute to enhancing cell death in response to an apoptotic signal in lymphocytes. There is also mixed evidence that it may have a role in mediating the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines during T cell activation. Thus, PDE7A is also a reasonable candidate for mediating the effect of the rs10808746 variant, and it is further possible that the variant influences the expression and function of both genes, possibly by affecting shared pathways involved in neuronal degeneration.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 33452, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Based on our power calculations, it is clear that substantially larger sample sizes including 10,000-15,000 subjects will be needed for a definitive investigation of the genetic architecture of the rate of cognitive decline. This estimate is in line with power calculations for other complex traits. The distribution of results from the ROS cohort suggest that it is unlikely that loci with a strong effect on cognitive decline exist outside of APOE. The existence of loci with more modest effects on cognitive decline is consistent with the suggestive evidence presented in support of CR1, a known AD susceptibility locus, and possibly PDE7A/MTFR1. We attempted to enhance our ability to test detect the role of genetic variation in cognitive decline by assessing aggregate measures of genetic risk for conditions that are well-known (AD, cerebrovascular disease, and type II diabetes) or hypothesized (inflammatory diseases) to influence this trait. Our aggregate measure of AD risk is nominally associated with cognitive decline, suggesting that this may be a fruitful strategy to deploy in future studies that leverage larger sample sizes and additional susceptibility alleles that will emerge in the near future.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 34670, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Our study was based on the hypothesis that common genetic pathways mediate the response and adaptation to diverse forms of brain pathology, and that variation in such loci might therefore impact age-related cognitive decline. This hypothesis is supported by observations from a variety of experimental paradigms of neuronal injury that several core cellular pathways, including protein misfolding/aggregation, autophagy, mitochondrial dynamics, and inflammation, play important roles in multiple neurodegenerative diseases. In prospective, community-based autopsy series of dementia, most brains are found to have multiple pathologies, which likely interact to produce the clinical manifestations of age-related cognitive decline. Our strategy of using cognitive trajectories as an outcome trait for a genome-wide scan holds great promise for the identification of core genetic mechanisms mediating cognitive reserve and adaptation to injury. However, our current study provides evidence that the genetic architecture of this trait may be similar to that of other complex human traits, involving common variants of modest effects.
