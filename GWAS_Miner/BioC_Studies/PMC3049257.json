Performing genomic control showed that hidden population substructures or differential genotype calling between cases and controls did not substantively influence these results (Online methods). Three SNPs on 2p21 (rs11894252, rs7579899 and rs6758592) were selected as well as single SNPs on 3q26.31 (rs9839909), 11q13.2 (rs7105934), and 12q24.31 (rs4765623).

The VHL complex targets HIF subunits for ubiquitin-mediated degradation. Accumulation of HIF-2alpha leads to up-regulation of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR).

Further, tumor formation in VHL-deficient renal carcinoma cells has been found to be suppressed by inhibition of HIF-2alpha.
