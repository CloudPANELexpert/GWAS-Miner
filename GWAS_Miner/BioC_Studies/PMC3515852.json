The use of intermediate phenotypes to identify genes involved in the pathophysiology of arterial thrombosis can yield stronger genetic associations. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have led to the discovery of key molecules regulating human disease and have identified genetic variants and novel genes associated with platelet number, platelet volume and in vitro platelet aggregation. However, no GWAS has identified genes associated with shear stress-dependent platelet function. The Platelet Function Analyzer-100  (PFA-100) measures the time to platelet thrombus formation under a defined shear stress of 1500 sec-1 in whole blood. The assay requires platelet tethering to VWF, firm adhesion to collagen, platelet activation and secretion, and platelet aggregation mediated by VWF and fibrinogen. Abnormal assay results correlate with platelet hyperfunction and hypofunction associated with acute coronary syndromes and bleeding disorders, respectively. The aim of this study was to identify genetic factors that influence platelet reactivity and thrombus formation under high shear stress. We carried out a genome-wide screen with the PFA-100  to identify novel gene variants in AAs and EAs.

This is not unusual since GWAS uses indirect association mapping with tagSNPs that are in LD with causal variants. However, despite a small sample size comprised of both EA and AA in our RNA expression study, eQTL analysis supported an association between these SNPs and SVIL mRNA levels (Figure 4C). Thus, at least one genetic mechanism by which SVIL variants may regulate platelet reactivity is by altering SVIL expression, perhaps via effects on transcription or mRNA stability.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 22353, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "title_2"}, "text": "SVIL expression in platelets", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 22382, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "SVIL mRNA was detected in platelets using a 3'UTR probe that recognizes all SVIL transcripts and a 5'UTR probe specific for nonmuscle supervillin (Figure 2). Archvillin mRNAs were not detected in our microarray expression study, consistent with prior data indicating that archvillin and SmAV are mainly expressed in muscle . In addition to the RNA data, immunoblotting with multiple antibodies demonstrated the presence of abundant supervillin protein in platelets. Using microarray analysis, Watkins et al. reported that SVIL mRNA is expressed in multiple hematopoietic cell types including CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells, CD14+ monocytes , CD19+ B-cells, CD56+ natural killer cells, and CD66b+ granulocytes . We also observed SVIL mRNA in CD45+ cells (Figure 2C), found supervillin protein in murine thymocytes, splenocytes, macrophages, and neutrophils by immunoblotting (unpublished data), and recovered Coomassie blue-staining amounts of supervillin from bovine neutrophils . While high levels of proteases may have caused degradation in human leukocyte lysates (Figure 3), supervillin is clearly expressed at moderately high levels in platelets (Figures 2C and 3, Supplemental Figure 1). And since PRP has some contamination with WBCs, our gene expression data suggest that SVIL mRNA is expressed at higher levels in platelets than WBCs (Figure 2C). The basis for the reproducibly faster migration of platelet supervillin, as compared with HeLa and A549 cell supervillin (Figure 3), is unclear because the predicted mRNAs are identical.

Although Svil-/- platelets are larger, they do not have greater surface expression of several critical adhesive glycoproteins (GPIbalpha or integrin alphaIIb), suggesting a possible membrane cytoskeletal defect, rather than premature release of larger platelets from megakaryocytes. There are several possible mechanisms by which supervillin might regulate platelet size. Filamin anchors the GPIb-IX-V complex to the platelet cytoskeleton and binds to supervillin ; an altered filamin-GPIbalpha interaction could produce larger platelets, such as those characteristic of inherited mutations in the gene encoding GPIbalpha . Other possible mechanisms include altered myosin II function similar to the MYH9-associated macrothrombocytopenias , or a simple disruption of the actin cytoskeleton that maintains normal platelet size, as in the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome .

Although the effect of supervillin on platelet adhesion is not dramatic, it is difficult to demonstrate gain-of-function effects, and the increased adhesion observed in Svil null platelets is well in line with other mouse mutants of signaling molecules that limit platelet activation. The mice used in these studies have Svil defects in all tissues, and we cannot exclude an indirect effect on platelets.

First, the larger initial volumes of unactivated Svil-/- platelets (Table 3) may contribute to their larger surface areas after activation. Second, the loss of supervillin could increase the rate of cell spreading by increasing integrin adhesion to the substrate, or by decreasing myosin II-mediated slowing of the cell spreading rate, as observed in other cell types . Finally, decreased integrity of the membrane-cytoskeleton connection could increase the apparent cross-sectional surface area if Svil-/- platelets are more sensitive to cortical disruption by high shear forces.

"paragraph"}, "text": "Platelets play a central role in ischemic arterial vascular disease, and anti-platelet therapies are mainstays of treatment. The findings in this study identify a novel platelet protein, supervillin, which functions to dampen the early formation of platelet thrombi under high shear stress. Although these results will not alter current management of vascular disease, there are potential clinical implications. Supervillin is an interaction hub for many proteins that regulate cell adhesion and contractility. Drug targeting of supervillin or one of its binding partners in a manner that would decrease platelet adhesion under high shear forces may have anti-thrombotic benefit for arterial vascular disease like MI and stroke. This benefit could be especially pronounced in African Americans, who suffer disproportionately from cardiovascular disease. Conversely, drugs that knowingly or unknowingly block supervillin function in platelets could have untoward effects of promoting thrombosis. The shear-dependence of the supervillin effect presents an opportunity to develop therapies that differentially impact on arterial and venous thrombosis by inhibiting platelet thrombus formation under high shear settings (e.g., acute coronary syndromes or PCI) without altering the normal hemostatic function of platelets in low-shear veins or micro-circulation. Lastly, SNPs strongly linked to the causative SVIL variant may be useful as a biomarker for risk of thrombosis or hemorrhage.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}], "annotations": [], "relations": []}]}
