Although our findings are consistent with prior work, they also provide evidence for a more comprehensive network, involving neuron migration, neurite outgrowth, neuronal morphogenesis, and synaptic plasticity, especially glutamatergic synaptic development. The glutamate system is a reasonable candidate for ADHD's pathophysiology as glutamate is the major excitatory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system, and regulates the catecholaminergic activity which has been implicated in ADHD by neurobiological and treatment studies.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 23961, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Although our findings are intriguing, we have only captured fragments of the puzzle of ADHD's etiology in this study. We could not paint the full picture. Our work must be considered in the context of its limitations. We had no genome-wide significant findings for any single variant, which might be due to the sample size. However, our bioinformatic and pathway analyses found some interesting genes and neurobiological pathways which implicate complex neurodevelopmental network underlying ADHD. Our finding of a significant polygenic component suggests that there are many common SNP variants with small effect sizes that increase the risk for ADHD. Individually, these SNPs will be difficult to detect with currently available sample sizes.
