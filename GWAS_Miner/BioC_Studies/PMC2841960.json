Beta-carotene oxygenase 2 (BCO2) catalyzes the asymmetric oxidative cleavage of beta-carotene metabolism. BCO2 may also be involved in biological processes other than vitamin A synthesis, because the gene is expressed in some tissues that are not related to vitamin A deficiency. Although vitamin A may affect the immune system, there is no evidence connecting vitamin A and plasma IL-18 levels. Thus, the mechanism underlying the association between SNP rs2115763 in BCO2 gene and IL-18 levels is unclear. Because the BCO2 gene is located on the upstream of IL18 gene, SNP rs2115763 might directly regulate the IL18 gene transcription. It is also possible that the SNP rs2115763 is a marker of functional mutation in IL18 gene affecting plasma IL-18 levels. SNP rs1834481 is an intronic SNP of IL18 gene. Several candidate gene studies found that SNPs in IL-18 gene were associated with plasma IL-18 levels in healthy and diseased individuals.
