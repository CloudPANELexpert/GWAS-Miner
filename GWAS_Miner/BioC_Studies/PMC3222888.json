It is distinct from other forms of optic neuropathy in that the neuroretinal rim of the optic nerve retains its normal pink color as it becomes progressively thinner, leading to an enlarged optic-nerve cup. POAG is the most common form of glaucoma. Excluding rare primary juvenile glaucoma with age of onset between 10 and 35 years, POAG is arbitrarily divided into high-pressure glaucoma (defined as >=22 mmHg) and normal-pressure glaucoma. POAG is thought to have a multifactorial etiology, with the main risk factors being age, elevated intraocular (IOP) pressure, family history, race, central corneal thickness (CCT), hypertension, diabetes and myopia.

This interaction generally results in inhibition of signaling. Caveolins have been suggested as regulators of adult neural stem cell proliferation, as evidenced by increased proliferation of adult neural stem cells in Cav1, Cav2 and Cav3 knockout mice.

Nitric oxide plays an important role in the regulation of many physiological functions in the cardiovascular system and the central and peripheral nervous systems. Nitric oxide produced in excessive amounts causes cytotoxicity, neurodegeneration, apoptotic cell death and circulatory failure.
