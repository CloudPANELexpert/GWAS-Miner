SNN encodes stannin, a highly conserved protein localized to the mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum membranes. The role of SNN in renin levels and BP regulation through the RAAS is unclear. SNN is upregulated in endothelial cells in response to the inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, suggesting that SNN may be involved in the inflammatory process leading to atherosclerosis. TXNDC11 (also known as EFP1) encodes thioredoxin domain-containing protein 11. The protein primarily exists in the endoplasmic reticulum and was recently identified as being important for proper endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) of MHC class I molecules. Using our baseline RNA-Seq data among PEAR whites, we identified rs3784921 as an eQTL for TXNDC11. Data from Haploreg show that rs3784921 is also an eQTL for SNN in whole blood. Furthermore, we were able to replicate the association with baseline PRA and the proxy SNP, rs1802409, in an independent study, PEAR-2. Together, these data suggest that there may be a functional connection between SNPs in this region, SNN and TXNDC11, and renin, the RAAS, and BP regulation, though the basis for this remains unclear.

These SNPs have expected regulatory function, show evidence of regulatory chromatin states in DNAse and enhancer histone marks in the brain, and are predicted to alter regulatory motifs. Additionally, there have been prior studies on CHD9, the closest gene to the associated region. A previous GWAS showed that a variant in CHD9 is associated with plasma fibrinogen concentration. While the role of CHD9 in the cardiovascular system, particularly the RAAS and BP regulation, is unclear, CHD9 is a transcriptional activator of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-alpha, a nuclear receptor that is widely expressed in the vasculature among other tissues and may be involved in BP regulation.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 24458, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "In African Americans, we identified two regions with suggestive evidence of association with baseline PRA and signals with BP response. rs7606603 in XIRP2, also known as CMYA3, was associated with baseline PRA and BP response to atenolol. XIRP2 is a member of the cardiac and skeletal muscle-specific actin-binding Xin gene family and encodes cardiomyopathy-associated protein 3, which is involved in protecting actin filaments from depolymerization. XIRP2 interacts with the RAAS and kallikrein-kininogen system but possibly more so as a mediator of angiotensin II-induced myocardial damage. Other studies have found angiotensin II increases XIRP2 expression by inducing transcription factor myocyte enhancer factor 2A or MEF2A. The connections between XIRP2, the RAAS, and the kallikrein-kininogen system are interesting given that a recent GWAS among normotensive individuals identified associations between renin activity and SNPs in the kininogen 1 and kallikrein B genes, which are both involved in the production of bradykinin. Further, the second region identified among African Americans is on chromosome 5, with the nearest coding gene, GHR, located ~230kb 3' of rs16872401. GHR is a member of the type I cytokine receptor family and encodes a transmembrane receptor that binds growth hormone.

Additionally, through BP response prioritization, we found a genome-wide significant locus (CHD9), and two other suggestive loci (XIRP2 and GHR). All of these loci were prioritized through directionally specific associations with BP response to a beta-blocker (atenolol) or thiazide diuretic (HCTZ). This method relies on the premise that genetic variants with a positive correlation with baseline PRA will have increased response to atenolol and decreased response to HCTZ. Conversely, we hypothesized that variants associated with lower baseline PRA will be associated with greater BP response to HCTZ and a lower response to atenolol. While there is literature evidence to support our hypothesis, including prior studies in the PEAR population, this direct method has never been tested before. As we only focused on SNPs that met the requirements of our prioritization scheme, we could have missed other signals that impact PRA. Additionally, none of variants were associated with BP response to both a beta-blocker (atenolol) and thiazide diuretic (HCTZ), in the expected directions.

We did not observe signals in the regions previously associated with PRA in normotensive individuals. It is possible that differences in the underlying genetic architecture between normotensive and hypertensive individuals, one of which may manifest as altered RAAS signalling for hypertensive individuals, may account for the dissimilar PRA signals across the two studies.

{"section_type": "SUPPL", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Only about half of adults with hypertension have controlled blood pressure (BP), which is due in part to inter-individual variability in BP response to antihypertensive agents. In addition to known clinical factors, components of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, including renin, have been associated with these differences in BP response. In order to identify biomarkers that could be used to predict antihypertensive response, we conducted a genome-wide association study with plasma renin activity (PRA) in hypertensive individuals. The top signals were prioritized and validated based on BP response to a beta-blocker and thiazide diuretic, gene expression differences by genotype, and replication in an independent sample. Our prioritization and validation strategy identified the SNN-TXNDC11 gene region. The G allele of rs3784921 was associated with higher baseline PRA and reduced systolic BP response to hydrochlorothiazide. In cis-expression quantitative trait locus analysis, T allele carriers at rs3784921 showed significantly higher expression for TXNDC11 and SNN compared to GG homozygotes. A proxy single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), rs1802409, replicated the PRA signal in an independent sample, and on meta-analysis the region showed a stronger association. Other signals associated with PRA and BP response to a beta-blocker or thiazide diuretic were identified in CHD9, XIRP2, and GHR. The regions identified in this study may help personalize selection of antihypertensive agents. These SNPs and regions should be tested in other independent cohorts to validate their role in PRA and BP response. Additionally, investigation into the functional role of these genes may provide further insight into the BP response mechanisms associated with beta-blockers and thiazide diuretics.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}], "annotations": [], "relations": []}]}
