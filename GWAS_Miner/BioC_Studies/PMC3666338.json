However, these phenotypes were not solely attributable to the loss of GIRK (1/2) signaling in dopamine neurons, but could be due to adaptations in the mesolimbic dopamine system that facilitated excitatory glutamatergic neurotransmission. Therefore the authors suggest that drugs of abuse may evoke adaptations to promote chronic use through a regulation of GIRK signaling strength in dopaminergic neurons or their input neurons.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 24371, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "In conclusion, the results of the present study suggesting a role for the KCNJ6 gene in variations of frontal theta band oscillations are very compelling. Although all the neurotransmitter interactions and the functional role of GIRK2 channels on brain electrophysiology and behavior is yet to be completely defined, there is robust evidence (as reviewed above) for an important role of this channel in regulating the excitability of neuronal networks. Our findings underscore the potential for identifying meaningful genetic correlates of brain oscillations associated with pathophysiology of neuropsychiatric conditions.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 24994, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Despite these strong findings, there are some limitations and caveats to bear in mind.
