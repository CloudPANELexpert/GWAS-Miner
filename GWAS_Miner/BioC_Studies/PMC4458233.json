As expected, individual alleles showing an association with IgE levels within the admixture mapping peaks had an enormous variation in minor allele frequency across populations (Figure E7). Exon sequencing further identified an association of pooled nonsynonymous variants with IgE levels in a gene implicated through admixture mapping (HLA-DQB1), but not in a gene implicated through conventional GWAS (ZNF365).

Genetic variation in ZNF365 was associated with atopic dermatitis in Japanese and Chinese populations, but not in Europeans. Atopic dermatitis is an allergic disease modulated through IgE, and therefore our association with IgE reinforces the role of ZNF365 in atopic phenotypes. However, we note that the association of the genome-wide significant indel in ZNF365 was in the opposite direction in GALA I compared to GALA II. Allele frequencies were similar among studies, imputation performed well (info score >=0.9), and we found no significant interaction with asthma. Therefore, our result could be attributed to differences in recruitment of patients or gene-environment interactions. The associated indel is located in the first intron of transcript variant D of ZNF365: an isoform whose differential expression has been previously associated with Crohn's disease. The combined set of variants within the first intron of ZNF365 transcript variant D with p<10-6 showed a 2.6-fold enrichment in enhancers in the lymphoblastoid cell line GM12878 (p=0.027), and a 6.7-fold enrichment in DNase sensitivity sites in CD20+ B cells (p=0.036).

In addition, our genome-wide significant associations are different from those previously described in GWAS involving European populations or Asian populations. Moreover, for the first time we implicated variation in HLA-DQA1 in affecting IgE levels. The most significantly associated SNP (rs113176001), is located within the intergenic region between HLA-DRB1 and HLA-DQA1, and is a strong eQTL for HLA-DQA1. Interestingly, this SNP was only an eQTL in lymphoblastoid cells in Europeans, but not in African individuals from the 1000 Genomes Project. Furthermore, it was not significantly associated with IgE levels in African Americans from the EVE consortium, although the direction of effect was the same. This could be due to variation in allele frequency between populations, as the minor allele of this SNP is more frequent in Latino and European populations from the 1000 Genomes Project (25% and 22% for the C allele, respectively) than in African populations (14%) (Figure E3).", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 26072, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Using admixture mapping we also uncovered an association of African ancestry at 13p22.1-q31.3 with lower levels of IgE.

African ancestry at 14q23.2 was associated with higher IgE levels both in Latinos and African Americans. Linkage studies previously identified 14q23 as a locus affecting IgE levels. However no associations of specific genes have been reported. Fine mapping of 14q23 in multiethnic groups narrowed the association to three candidate genes: KCNH5 and RHOJ through variants nominally associated in Latinos, and GPHB5 in African Americans. These three genes are expressed by immune cells such us T lymphocytes, B cells, and plasma cells, but they have not been associated before with IgE levels or allergic phenotypes.

In addition, IgE levels were measured using different methods across the replication studies, which may account for the lack of the replication of some of the findings. Furthermore, we note that Latinos are a heterogeneous group and therefore findings from this study may not be generalizable to all Latino populations.
