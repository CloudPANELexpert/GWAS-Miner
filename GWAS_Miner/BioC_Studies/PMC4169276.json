There is a substantial genetic contribution to OF in addition to low bone mineral density (BMD) and the heritability of this condition is therefore relatively high. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of osteoporosis have successfully identified predominant genetic variants for BMD in Eurocentric populations. The OF risk increases as BMD values fall and osteoporosis is thus clinically defined by the measurement of BMD, the most widely used predictor for fracture risk. Although BMD is useful as a surrogate marker for OF, about two thirds of individuals who suffer a fracture do not have osteoporosis on the basis of their BMD values. This indicates that identifying genetic factors responsible for OF will be very valuable. Despite identification of novel genes or loci, GWAS are fundamentally limited in terms of their ethnic specificity and ability to establish functional implications.

Despite the limited number of postmenopausal women in the AMC cohort (n=982) and discovery state, we recently performed targeted resequencing of the MECOM gene in the cases with OF (n=164) and controls (n=818) (see online supplementary data and online supplementary table S3). We identified 66 MECOM SNPs (data not shown), and a further three SNPs in genes associated with the risk of OF (see online supplementary table S4). Although this screen should be replicated in a larger cohort and further in vitro studies identifying their function are needed, we believe that these results provide additional evidence for the link between the MECOM gene and the risk of fracture.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 22755, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Previous GWAS studies demonstrate that the MECOM gene has multiple diverse effects on phenotypic traits including aging, blood pressure, mean arterial pressure, serum magnesium concentration, lung (pulmonary) function, and nasopharyngeal carcinoma.
