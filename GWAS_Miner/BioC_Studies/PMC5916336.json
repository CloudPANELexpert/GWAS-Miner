The association was strongest for flushing, next strongest for MAXDRINKS, then AD-CrC - consistent with the accepted mechanism of action, where rs671 inactivates ALDH2, leading to impaired clearing of acetaldehyde, the toxic first metabolic product of ethanol in its primary metabolic pathway. Presumably the aversive effect of the flushing reaction acts as a deterent to ethanol injestion. Acetaldehyde is directly responsible for the flushing reaction. Rs671, a glutamine to lysine substitution (E487K), results in inactivation of the enzyme subunit. Biochemistry studies - based on ALDH2 activity in liver samples - suggest that the \"null\" rs671 allele has a nearly dominant effect; the heterozygote retains only about 17% enzyme activity compared to common-allele heterozygotes; minor-allele homozygotes had nearly nil measurable enzyme activity. We did not observe a significant association between ADH1B variants and any of the alcohol-related traits, but this may be attributable to lack of power: acceptable genotype data for that locus was available only for Sample 2 (510 subjects), and in that sample, we did observe a nominally-significant association (p = 2.72 x 10-5). Since acetaldehyde is implicated in various digestive tract cancers as well, these results may be relevant to a range of pathologies beyond AD per se.

Since the analysis used summary statistics from depression to predict the alcohol-related phenotypes, the outsize effect of the ALDH2 region in the latter phenotypes would not be expected to be a major confound; indeed, the most significant association between ALDH2 and major depression in the CONVERGE sample is 0.041 (and the smallest p-value in the 2Mb region is 0.0049). ALDH2*rs671 is absent from the CONVERGE dataset, again supporting that the effect is not driven by that marker.

This result most likely reflects random variation in the context of a large effect size in a comparatively small sample, and is illustrative of the difficulties commonly faced in identifying the true risk variant from a long associated region. Additionally, rs671 was genotyped directly, but the other lead variants were both imputed. Imperfect imputation could be an additional source of noise obfuscating the signal from rs671.

Prior studies in other, much larger, samples, in different populations, have shown association not only with alcohol metabolizing genes, but with variants mapping elsewhere as well. That we identified strong evidence for association only at and near ALDH2, most likely reflects the limited sample size available to us. When larger Asian samples characterized for AD are available, it is a strong expectation that additional risk loci will be identified. Likewise, the limited pleiotropy results reflect both the sample size limitation in the present study, and the lack of other GWAS in Asian populations for comparison purposes.", "sentences": [],
