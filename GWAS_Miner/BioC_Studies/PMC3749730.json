Specifically, in each population, we fitted a logistic regression model for case/control status with no covariates at each SNP with a single parameter for the genetic effect (a multiplicative effect on the risk scale, additive on the log-odds scale). We then assumed a fixed underlying genetic effect, common to all populations, for the SNP, which we estimated by combining the effect estimates across populations, weighting by the precision of the estimate within each population. P-values, effect size estimates and confidence individuals for each population, and combined across populations are shown in Supplementary Table 2, see also Supplementary Figure 4. As is typical for GWAS replication studies which type a small number of SNPs, testing for possible substructure within populations is not possible. Our replication results involve averaging across separate results for seven populations. This provides robustness against false positives due to substructure in some populations, and it is encouraging that most or all replication populations typically exhibit evidence for the signal. We confirmed the power of this replication cohort by genotyping SNPs rs4085613 and rs4112788 which tag the known LCE3B/3C psoriasis risk locus, where we observed replication P values of 2.33 x 10-15 and 4.44 x 10-16, respectively.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 21863, "infons": {"section_type": "METHODS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "To look for interactions between associated loci we considered all pairs of index SNPs from Tables 1 and 2 and for each pair we compared two logistic regression models. In the first (null) model, a separate parameter for each SNP specifies the multiplicative increase in the odds of disease with each additional copy of the risk allele for that SNP. We compared this, via a likelihood ratio test, to a model for interaction in which there is a third parameter which modifies the effect associated with carrying risk alleles at both SNPs. There are many different ways to model both the marginal effects at each SNP and their joint effect, and so many approaches to search for interactions. The procedure we adopted is perhaps the simplest (multiplicative model marginally at each SNP and a single additional parameter for multiplicative interactions). Having identified the interaction between the HLA-C and ERAP1 loci, we examined the nature of the effect, and observed that it takes the simple, and easily interpretable, form in which additional copies of the index SNP at ERAP1 only affect disease risk in HLA-C positive individuals. To test for interactions between SNPs in the replication data we included a categorical covariate indicating population membership to the logistic regression model.

In the replication study, four SNPs were typed in the HLA (rs10484554, rs3906272, rs12111032 and rs2243868), two of which (rs12111032 and rs2243868) form a near-perfect (false positive rate < 1%) haplotype tag for CW*0602 (alleles A and G on the plus strand respectively). Imputations were performed by phasing the four SNPs with PHASE and assuming the AG haplotype to be a perfect tag. From the independent validation study we estimate the false positive rate of this approach to be 9% (no call threshold), the decrease in accuracy resulting from uncertainty in phasing. As a check, we then applied the imputation approach we used in the replication data to the GWAS samples.

Genes within the recombination region of the hit SNP are labeled except for 19p13, where the genes are: GLP-1, FDX1L, RAVER1, ICAM3, TKY2, CDC37, PDE4A, KEAP1, S1PR5.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 29774, "infons": {"file": "emss-48359-f0003.jpg", "id": "F3", "section_type": "FIG", "type": "fig_caption"}, "text": "Statistical interaction between ERAP1 and HLA-C genotypes.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 29833, "infons": {"file": "emss-48359-f0003.jpg", "id": "F3", "section_type": "FIG", "type": "fig_caption"}, "text": "Odds ratio estimates for ERAP1 genotypes at rs27524 stratified by HLA-C genotypes at rs10484554.
