This variant is a tag for the HLA-A*0201 allele in individuals of European ancestry, and the effect of rs2523822 and A*0201 were indistinguishable in the Northwestern European subset of this study. When considered as an individual risk factor, the effect of A*0201 was seen only in cases of Northwestern European, and not Spanish, origin. This is in spite of the most strongly associated SNP in this region (rs2523822) showing an effect of similar magnitude in both populations. Nevertheless, the OR for A*0201 in the Spanish subset was also in the same direction as for the other subjects. Comparison of the LD patterns in Northwestern versus Southern European subsets showed that rs2523822 is indeed strongly correlated with A*0201 in Northwestern Europeans (r2=0.96), but not in Spanish (r2=0.64). Given this observation, and the high degree of functional variation in the MHC region, one plausible explanation is that A*0201 is not the actual causal variant underlying the association with rs2523822, but merely happens to be an adequate \"tag\" for the causal site(s) in Northwestern Europeans, but not in the Spanish. Similarly, since the most significant class II association in Northwestern Europeans rs9274407 was still significantly associated conditioned on HLA-DRB1*1501-DQB1*0602 (or its tag SNP rs3135388) but the opposite was not true, there is a possibility that the causal variant(s) may lie in another class II locus. Further investigation of genetic variation in the MHC region, and functional assessment of these variants in the context of AC-DILI will be necessary to identify the causal site(s) securely. The differences between populations in terms of risk associated with class I HLA allele are somewhat similar to the situation with serious skin rash (SSR) induced by antiepileptic drugs in East Asians where HLA-B*1502 is a risk factor in Han Chinese but not in other groups such as Japanese.

An interaction of this nature appears biologically plausible in view of the complementary roles for the class I and class II HLA gene products in the T-cell response. If validated, this demonstrates the kind of gene-by-gene interaction that has often been speculated on but rarely observed in studies of complex traits in humans.
