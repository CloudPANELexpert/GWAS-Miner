The rationale for including the ectopic fat traits, the adjustment models, and the sex-stratified analyses was 4-fold. First, ectopic fat measures are correlated with each other and with general adiposity and we wished to adjust for these factors as potential confounders or intermediates and to examine the genetic associations independent of the adjustment factor. Please see refer to Supplementary Table 7 for pairwise correlations of all traits within FHS, the largest participating cohort. For example, the correlation between VAT and BMI is 0.71 to 0.75 and adjusting for BMI when examining VAT provides the relative amount of VAT controlling for degree of general adiposity. Although the correlations between VAT/SAT ratio and BMI are modest, adjusting for BMI allowed us to examine the propensity to store fat viscerally compared to subcutaneously independent of general adiposity. Second, adjustment of covariates reduces the residual variance of the trait associated with the given covariate and thus increases power to detect genetic associations. Third, in the adiposity genetics literature there is evidence of sexually dimorphic loci in which the variance explained is larger in women versus men and association of the loci is markedly stronger in women compared to men, and vice versa.
