Sex-stratified association analyses were performed in the male and female subgroups. In males, the most significant association signal was detected in SNP rs685395 in DYNC2H1 with bivariate spine BMD and alcohol drinking (P = 1.94 x 10-8).

From the perspective of biological processes, it has been reported that mutations in DYNC2H1 can lead to chondrodysplasia, and that this gene was essential for skeletogenesis and growth. Also, mutations in human DYNC2H1 are associated with short rib-polydactyly syndrome type III and asphyxiating thoracic dystrophy. These two related skeletal dysplasias are characterized by shortened long bones, a narrow rib cage and polydactyly, and other features of ciliopathies. Chondrocyte cilia from individuals with DYNC2H1 mutations are shortened with bulbous distal ends. In particular, a number of studies have suggested that there is a connection between cilia and Wnt signaling. A systematic analysis of canonical Wnt signaling in mutant mouse embryos with abnormal primary cilia due to defects in DYNC2H1 showed that DYNC2H1 may play an indirect role in Wnt signaling, which is recognized as a classic signaling pathway related to bone development. However, the potential mechanisms by which DYNC2H1 variants influence alcohol drinking are completely unknown. A GWAS has identified groups of genomic markers, including DYNC2H1, associated with successful quitting in a smoking cessation trial that the examined effects of precessation nicotine replacement therapy. Homozygous missense mutations in DYNC2H1 reduce the rate of retrograde transport in motor neurons and affect the survival of sensory neurons. These observations indicate that defects in axonal transport are associated with neuronal degeneration. Three genetic pathways were associated with DYNC2H1: vasopressin-regulated water reabsorption, phagosome function, and Salmonella infection. Among them, the vasopressin-regulated water reabsorption and phagosome function pathways mainly reflect intracellular processes, transport, and catabolism. Both of these pathways have been associated with asphyxiating thoracic dystrophy caused by shortened ribs and the nervous system disease distal hereditary motor neuropathies. The analyses conducted in the current study provide support for the concept that DYNC2H1 is a potential candidate gene affecting both spine BMD and alcohol drinking in males.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 18080, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The current study also provided potential pleiotropic roles of GRIK4 in males and OPRM1 and IL1RN in females affecting BMD and alcohol drinking. GRIK4 is a critical regulator of network activity that acts by modifying neuronal excitability through GABA (gamma amino acid butyric acid) ergic interneurons. A GWAS in 367 Caucasian participants found GRIK4 as a leading edge gene contributing to human variants in alcohol response. The effect of GRIK4 on alcohol drinking may be attributed to its impact on the central nervous system. GRIK4 is also involved in the glutamatergic synapse and neuro-active ligand-receptor interaction pathways. Glutamate is the major excitatory neurotransmitter in the mammalian central nervous system, and has important physiologic significance for neural plasticity and opioid dependence. It is interesting that the neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction pathway contains both OPRM1 and GRIK4 found in the present study. OPRM1, a typical candidate gene for alcohol consumption, has been reported to be associated with alcoholism in Asian, American, and European populations. Apart from morphine addiction and neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction pathways, OPRM1 also plays a role in the estrogen signaling pathway. Alcohol is known to increase aromatization, so moderate alcoholic beverage consumption and serum estradiol levels are closely related. Moderate alcohol consumption is an important factor for postmenopausal estrogen status, and it is well documented that estrogen levels closely relate to BMD in females. The effects of estrogens on trabecular versus cortical bone mass are mediated by direct effects on osteoclasts and osteoblasts. The protection of cortical bone mass by estrogens is mediated via estrogen receptor alpha. One important mechanism by which estrogen inhibits bone resorption is that estrogen can inhibit the production of specific cytokines (e.g., IL-1, IL-6), thus inhibiting osteoclast formation. IL-1 receptor antagonist is a protein that binds to IL-1 receptors and inhibits the binding of IL-1alpha and IL-1beta. Several published studies that focused on bone development related pathways or gene networks implicated IL1RN as having an effect on BMD or osteoporosis. Mutations in IL1RN have been identified in monogenic autoinflammatory bone disorders that have allowed more detailed dissection of immunologic defects that can produce sterile osteomyelitis. Allelic variation at the IL1RN locus is associated with differential rates of early postmenopausal bone loss in the spine. At the same time, there is growing evidence for the involvement of proinflammatory cytokines in alcohol dependence.

Cytokines are pleiotropic proteins that coordinate the host inflammatory response, and also mediate signaling between cells of nonimmune tissues, including the nervous system. It is well known that several members of the cytokine family are present in the brain. IL-1 activity in the brain has been related to the differentiation of dopaminergic neurons and the modulation of central monoaminergic activity.
