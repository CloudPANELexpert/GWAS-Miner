Genome-wide association (GWA) studies have also been used successfully to identify genetic variation associated with quantitative traits, such as lipid levels and body mass index.

To begin to answer these important questions, we used adult height as a model phenotype. Adult height is a complex trait with high heritability (h2 ~0.8-0.9 within individual populations). Furthermore, height is accurately measured and relatively stable over a large part of the lifespan, and data is available for very large numbers of individuals. Thus, the study of height is an ideal opportunity to dissect the architecture of a highly polygenic trait in humans.

The modest effects observed also highlight the importance of using large datasets to identify 'true' stature variants: the HMGA2 SNP was first found in a combined analysis of the DGI and Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium UKT2D datasets (n = 4,921 individuals), and the GDF5-UQCC finding was identified initially in an analysis of the SardiNIA and FUSION results (n = 6,669 individuals).

All participants were of European ancestry. Because genome-wide genotyping in these studies was done on different platforms (Affymetrix 500K for DGI, KORA, and SardiNIA, Illumina 317K for FUSION and Illumina 550K for NHS and PLCO), we imputed genotypes for all polymorphic markers in the HapMap Phase II CEU reference panel in each GWA scan using the program MACH (Y. Li and G.R.A., unpublished data), thereby generating compatible datasets of 2,260,683 autosomal SNPs. Adult height was tested for association with these SNPs in each study under an additive genetic model, and association results were combined by meta-analysis using a weighted Z-score method (Methods). Whereas the distribution of test statistics for each individual GWA study was consistent with the expectation under the null hypothesis (Fig. 1), the quantile-quantile plot of the meta-analysis results clearly showed a large excess of low P values at the right tail of the distribution, despite minimal evidence of overall systematic bias (lambdaGC = 1.089; Fig. 2a). This result suggests that true associations with height variation, which were not discernable from the background in the individual studies, were brought to light in the combined analysis. Indeed, the second- and third-strongest association signals in these height meta-analysis results:HMGA2 rs1042725 (P = 2.6 x 10-11) and GDF5-UQCC rs6060369 (P = 1.9 x 10-10):have recently been shown to be robustly associated with stature in humans not selected for tall or short stature.

In the first stage, we selected 78 SNPs representative of the top association signals (ranked by P values, and taking into account linkage disequilibrium (LD) to minimize redundancy); we then genotyped these 78 SNPs in a panel of European Americans (n = 2,189) ascertained from the near-ends of the normal height distribution (short, 5-10th percentile; tall, 90-95th percentile) (Supplementary Table 2 online). This panel has been used previously to replicate very strongly the HMGA2 rs1042725 association. To decrease the number of false positives taken into the second stage and retain true associations with height, we selected for further study 29 SNPs that had an odds ratio in the European American panel that was consistent with the direction of the effect observed in the meta-analysis (Methods). We genotyped these SNPs in four large validation (replication) panels: all 29 SNPs were genotyped in the population-based FINRISK97 cohort (n = 7,803), and a subset was genotyped in the population-based KORA S4 (n = 4,130) and PPP (n = 3,402) cohorts and the type 2 diabetes case-control FUSION stage 2 panel (n = 2,466) (Supplementary Tables 3-6 online). Because of logistic and technical issues, not all 29 SNPs could be genotyped in all four DNA panels, thus leading to a loss in power for some of these SNPs in our follow-up strategy. Nevertheless, these combined efforts led to the identification of 12 SNPs with combined P < 5 x 10-7 (using evidence from the meta-analysis and the validation panels except the European American panel, because of its specific ascertainment), a level of significance strongly suggestive of true association (Table 1; detailed association results and LD plots are given in Supplementary Table 7 and Supplementary Fig. 2 online, respectively). Of the three loci with P values between 5 x 10-7 and 5 x 10-8, two were confirmed in the accompanying manuscript (SH3GL3-ADAMTSL3 and CDK6), and one had strong independent evidence of association in the European American tall-short (USHT) panel (CHCHD7-RDHE2, P = 9 x 10-6; Table 1). This indicates that loci with P values in this range are at least enriched for loci with valid associations with height. In addition, four loci showed overall suggestive evidence (combined P < 5 x 10-6) of association with adult height (Table 1). Although SNP rs2730245 at the WDR60 locus has a combined P = 3 x 10-7, we chose to include this marker in our list of suggestive associations because, unlike the 12 loci in the top section of Table 1, this signal had a follow-up P > 0.05.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 10241, "infons": {"section_type": "RESULTS", "type": "title_2"}, "text": "Characterization of signals associated with height", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 10292, "infons": {"section_type": "RESULTS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Population stratification is a possible strong confounder for association studies of height and other human phenotypes.

Second, the naturally occurring Komeda miniature rat Ishikawa mutant, which has general longitudinal growth retardation, results from a deletion in the rat gene encoding cGKII. Therefore, in rodents, it is clear that cGKII has a role in skeletal growth, acting as a molecular switch between chondrocyte proliferation and differentiation.

Third, each variant makes only a small contribution to phenotypic variation (although determining the total contribution of each of the loci reported here requires much more comprehensive resequencing and genotyping); thus, either many hundreds of common variants influence complex traits such as height and/or other genetic contributors (for example, gene-gene or gene-environment interactions, rare variants with large effects, or uncaptured genomic features such as structural polymorphisms) will play a significant role. In particular, because the quality-control criteria used in the GWA studies analyzed here would have removed SNPs affected by copy number polymorphisms, we cannot conclude anything regarding the role of these variants on adult height. With the development of new platforms and improved analytical tools applicable to large cohorts, it is likely that the role of common structural variants on human complex traits such as adult height will soon be elucidated.

The imputation method combines genotype data from each sample with the HapMap CEU samples (July 2006 phased haplotype release) and then infers the unobserved genotypes probabilistically. The inference relies on the identification of stretches of haplotype shared between study samples and individuals in HapMap CEU reference panel. For each SNP in each individual, imputation results are summarized as an 'allele dosage' defined as the expected number of copies of the minor allele at that SNP (a fractional value between 0.0 and 2.0). As previously described, r2 between each imputed genotype and the true underlying genotype is estimated and serves as a quality-control metric (rsq_hat in Supplementary Table 7).

From the meta-analysis, we selected 78 SNPs (three iPLEX pools; six SNPs failed) for genotyping in the European American tall-short panel (n = 2,189): SNPs were first ranked using their meta-analytic P values, and then binned using the LD pattern from the HapMap Phase II CEU population (SNPs with r2 >0.5 to a SNP with a lower P value were binned together with that SNP). When a locus had more than one high-ranking bin, we only genotyped the most significant SNP such that only one SNP per locus or gene was genotyped.
