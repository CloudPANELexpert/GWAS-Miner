We had four independent study samples enabling comparison of the results between data sets, and meta-analysis. In addition, a moderate portion of our sample is rather young, in terms of a late-onset syndrome such as MetS and its component traits  and thus individuals diagnosed with MetS may have a stronger genetic component and less environmental factors masking the effect of genes, which may aid in unearthing the genetic susceptibility loci.

To date, genetic studies have identified several susceptibility regions in the genome for MetS component traits, but have had variable success in identifying susceptibility loci to the syndrome as an entity. We searched for MetS susceptibility loci by conducting a genome-wide association (GWA) study on MetS and its component traits in >10000 individuals. Furthermore, we searched for evidence of a common genetic background for MetS by investigating the top GWA loci with transcriptome and NMR-based metabonomics data and testing for loci associated with multiple MetS component traits using factor analysis. We also examined whether a genetic risk score derived from loci associated with one or more component traits of MetS associates with the MetS diagnosis. Importantly, we saw a strong lipid gene contribution to the observed MetS associations. There was little evidence for pleiotropy linking dyslipidemia and obesity to the other types of metabolic abnormalities: glucose intolerance and hypertension. We conclude that there are probably no common gene variants predisposing to the metabolic syndrome by affecting multiple components of its definition that have a clinically relevant effect size.
