To extend coverage to the genomic region, whole-genome imputation was performed for SNPs that were not genotyped, and the genotype data of 2,178,018 autosomal SNPs with minor allele frequency (MAF) >= 0.01 was obtained. Each SNP was evaluated for association with BMI using a linear regression model, assuming additive effects of allele dosages on the rank-based inverse normal transformed values of BMI.

To our knowledge, our study is the first report on the association with adult BMI. The CDKAL1 locus has been reported to be a risk locus of type 2 diabetes (T2D). We found that the T allele of rs2206734, which decreased BMI, significantly increased T2D risk in our study subjects (P < 1.4 x 10-18; Supplementary Table 6). CDKAL1 risk variants for T2D were associated with decreased insulin secretion; therefore, the observed effects of the CDKAL1 risk variant on decreasing BMI might be mediated by decreased insulin secretion.
