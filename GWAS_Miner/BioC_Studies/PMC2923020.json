Neither TMEM129, SLBP nor TACC3 has been previously implicated in UBC. In the adjacent LD block, centromeric to TACC3 and 70 kb away from rs798766, is FGFR3, which encodes fibroblast growth factor receptor 3.

In TaG1 tumors, FGFR3 mutations are associated with an increased risk of local recurrence, and in Ta and T1 tumors overall, FGFR3 mutations are associated with a reduced risk of progression.

Notably, the variant also associates with increased expression of FGFR3 and TACC3 in adipose tissue and FGFR3 protein level and somatic mutations of the FGFR3 gene in Ta bladder tumors. Intriguingly, recent studies of UBC showed that some microRNAs that are commonly downregulated in low-risk tumors are negative regulators of FGFR3, and that the resulting upregulation of FGFR3 expression appears to precede mutations in the gene. Our observations are compatible with this model. Thus, it can be speculated that increased expression of FGFR3, caused either by germline variation or by downregulation of microRNAs targeting FGFR3 RNA, may lead to carcinogenesis in at least two ways. First, increased production of FGFR3 protein may increase the rate of urothelial proliferation and thus facilitate the accumulation of mutations that contribute to UBC development. Second, increased transcription may increase the chance of mutation in the FGFR3 gene itself.
