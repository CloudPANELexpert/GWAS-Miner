In particular, the inclusion of age-matched controls rather than, for example, postoperative controls or others at high risk for delirium, may decrease our power to detect association by misclassifying some individuals who would be at high risk as controls. While we applied a definition previously published, complementary studies incorporating specific assessment for delirium based on non-code data elements will be valuable. Further, groups have operationalized delirium using similar but not identical code definitions. Moreover, while this cohort is substantially larger than those previously reported, power is likely to be modest in the absence of single loci of large effect. We present these results in the hopes they will spur others to consider investigation of biobanks or registries in the same manner.
