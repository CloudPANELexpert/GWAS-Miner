Enrichment analyses test for over-representation of cell-type specific biofeatures intersecting risk variants at confirmed risk loci, compared to a lack of enrichment in non-disease associated tissues. A major strength of our approach was the ability to interrogate histotype-specific epigenomic profiles and so in addition to identifying the putative functional targets of risk SNPs, these analyses can also indicate whether some cell types are more likely to be relevant to disease pathogenesis compared to other cell types. For example we detected a significant enrichment of active chromatin marks coinciding with SNPs in fallopian tube epithelial cells at the 10q24.33 LGSOC/borderline serous locus, which could reflect recent pathological evidence that some of these tumors arise in the distal fallopian tube , as well as HGSOC . At the same locus, we also identified an enrichment for biofeatures in a primary MOC cell line, a cancer histotype that is often associated with deregulation of the MAPK pathway; which is also perturbed in LGSOC . Given the growing evidence that regulatory mechanisms are highly tissue specific, it is perhaps to be expected that we find such enrichments in cell types associated with EOC development. However, the lack of enrichment at MOC and ENOC risk loci may indicate that alternative precursor cell types give rise to these histotypes rather than the cell types evaluated in the current study.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 22564, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Expression QTL analysis identified associations between the most statistically significant risk-associated SNPs at 10q24.33 and OBFC1, many of which also coincide with epigenetic biofeatures.

OBFC1 also appears to function in a telomere-associated complex that binds telomeric single-stranded DNA in vitro and localizes at telomeres in vivo . Four SNPs in this region (rs2487999, rs4387287, rs9420907 and rs9419958) have previously been reported to be associated with telomere length (NHGRI-EBI GWAS catalog , Supplementary table 14).

However, the associations of all four with LGSOC and borderline serous EOC are attenuated when adjusted for rs7902587 suggesting a single association peak. The alleles associated with a decrease in leukocyte telomere length being associated with an increased risk of LGSOC and borderline serous EOC. These findings are consistent with the association between borderline EOC and rs7705526 at 5p15 (adjacent to the telomerase reverse transcriptase gene).

As the largest study to date with over 90,000 EOC cases and controls including an additional ~25,000 previously unstudied participants, we identify several novel risk loci specific to the rarer EOC histotypes: ENOC, MOC, LGSOC and borderline EOC. The histotype-specific nature of these associations adds to the somatic, epidemiological and clinical data indicating that EOC histotypes can be thought of as distinct diseases. The lack of heterogeneity between studies of varying designs, carried out in different populations, and the high levels of statistical significance, with confirmation of known EOC susceptibility loci, provide evidence that these are robust associations. Molecular analyses of genes and the tissue specific regulatory architecture at these loci, which combined publicly available datasets with systematic, large-scale genome wide profiling experiments, point to a small number of non-coding biofeatures and target genes that may play a histotype-specific role in EOC initiation and development. Detailed functional studies will be required to define the underlying biology of SNP-regulatory interactions to identify the causal SNP(s) at each locus, and to confirm which candidate susceptibility genes represent the targets of these risk SNPs. Evolving technologies, in particular CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing, now enable precision modification of risk SNPs to create isogenic models of different alleles , enabling the effects of each allele on disease pathogenesis to be studied, for example at 19p13 , 8q24 , 17q12  and 5p15 . Finally, given that several previously identified EOC susceptibility alleles are associated with risk of other cancers , and that there are similarities in molecular phenotype and/or shared tissue of origin between endometrial cancer, endometriosis and ENOC and CCOC  as well as basal-like breast cancer , we anticipate that the loci reported here may be also associated with risk of other cancer-related traits.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 27132, "infons": {"section_type": "METHODS", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "METHODS", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 27140, "infons": {"section_type": "METHODS", "type": "title_2"}, "text": "Study samples", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 27154, "infons": {"section_type": "METHODS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Genotype data from six OCAC and two CIMBA genotyping projects were used for these analyses (Supplementary table 1).
