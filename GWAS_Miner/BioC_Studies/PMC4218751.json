After extensive data cleaning, 1,465 cases, 5,557 ancestry-matched controls and 400 complete trios remained, with a common set of 469,410 autosomal and 9,657 X-chromosome SNPs. Ancestry-stratified case-control association analyses were conducted for three genetically-defined subpopulations and combined in two meta-analyses, with and without the trio-based analysis. In the case-control analysis, the lowest two p-values were located within DLGAP1 (p=2.49x10-6 and p=3.44x10-6), a member of the neuronal postsynaptic density complex.

After removing low performing SNP assays and DNA samples, we analyzed 400 trios, 1,465 cases and 5,557 controls for 469,410 autosomal and 9,657 X-chromosome SNPs. The trio and case-control subsamples were analyzed individually, and then these results were combined in both case-control and trio-case-control meta-analyses. One SNP, rs6131295, located on chromosome 20p12.1-p12.2, approximately ~90 kb from the BTBD3 gene, achieved genome-wide significance in the trio analysis (p=3.84x10-8), but not in the combined trio case-control meta-analysis, suggesting that further examination will be required using independent samples. BTBD3 is a member of a large family of transcription factors, which includes BTBD9, a gene that has been associated with Tourette Syndrome, a disorder frequently co-morbid with OCD. BTBD3 participates in multiple cellular functions including transcriptional regulation, cytoskeleton dynamics, ion channel assembly and gating, protein ubiquitination and degradation and has also been associated with primary open-angle glaucoma. BTBD3 is expressed in the brain, with the highest observed levels in childhood and adolescence (www.BrainSpan.org, Release 3), when OCD frequently emerges. rs6131295 is a cis-eQTL for BTBD3 in the frontal cortex (p=0.028), a region that has repeatedly been implicated in OCD. This SNP is also a parietal cis-eQTL for ISM1 (20p12;p=0.0036) and an LCL trans-eQTL for DHRS11 (17q11.2;p=0.0001).", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 19505, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Interestingly, the brain-wide expression pattern of DHRS11 and ISM1 are highly correlated with the expression of several of the other genes found among the top hits of both the case-control and the trio-case-control meta-analyses (www.BrainSpan.org, Release 3) (Supplementary Figure S12). Furthermore, many of these genes have been implicated in glutamate signaling. Specifically, ISM1 (C20orf82) is correlated with expression of pre-synaptically-located ADCY8 (0.61, rank 11 of 22,328 transcripts), the gene with the seventh strongest OCD-association in the trio-case-control meta-analysis, which has also been associated with bipolar disorder and with fear memory. ISM1 is also correlated with brain-wide expression of numerous glutamate-related genes including GRIK4 (0.565, rank 66), DLGAP3 (0.576,rank 44), GRIK1 (0.595,rank 22), SHANK3 (0.598,rank 21) as well as ADARB2 (0.600,rank 19), which contains the SNP with the best p-value in this study among previously reported candidate genes (Supplementary Table S4), and lies within a childhood-onset OCD linkage peak. Similarly, the expression of DHRS11 (MGC4172) is strongly correlated (0.847, rank 25 of 22,328 transcripts) with that of FAIM2, which is located in the same LD block as the best SNP (rs297941) in the trio-case-control, and fifth best in the case-control meta-analyses. FAIM2 has been associated with neuroprotection following transient brain ischemia. The rat homologue of FAIM2, neural membrane protein 35 (NMP35), is expressed at the post-synaptic membrane in a subset of synapses and in dendrites, and co-localizes with the glutamate receptor GluR2. Thus, there is a potential relationship between rs6131295 (trio analysis), and FAIM2 and ADCY8 (tagged by the SNPs ranked numbers 1 and 7 in the trio-case-control analysis).", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 21304, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The top two SNPs associated in the case-control meta-analysis (both with p<3x10-5 in the trio-case-control meta-analysis) are located in DLGAP1, another gene which influences glutamate signaling.

Another member of this gene family, DLGAP3, has been implicated in compulsive-like behavior in a mouse model (SAPAP3).

Certainly the decrease in significance of the p-value to 3.62x10-5 when the trio data is meta-analyzed with the much larger case-control sample data suggests so. On the other hand, our attempts to determine whether this finding was spurious did not find any evidence of such, as detailed here: 1) The intensity plot for this SNP has three tight, separated, clusters (Figure S10a); 2) There were no missing genotypes in the trio sample and there were no Mendelian errors; 3) Two nearby directly genotyped SNPs with low r2 values (0.2-0.4) had p-values within the 10-2 range, demonstrating very low statistical significance (Figure S10b); and 4) Imputation of the trio sample provided additional results that are not inconsistent with a true positive finding. Of the 40 regional SNPs examined, those with large r2 values (>0.90) and similar minor allele frequencies to rs6131295 had strong p-values in the range of 10-6 and 10-7 (Table S7 and Figure S11). Moreover, the surrounding SNPs in low r2 with rs6131295 all have an opposite direction of risk effect, which may partially explain why they have much less significant p-values. Although these imputed data and the above noted facts cannot prove that rs6131295 is a true positive, they do not support the hypothesis that it is a false positive.

This suggests that these top signals may have a broad role in gene expression in the brain, and possibly in the etiology of OCD. In the trio sample, we observed a genome-wide significant result for rs6131295, which is located near BTBD3, and is an eQTL for BTBD3, DHRS11 and ISM1. The expression of these latter two genes are highly correlated with other top hits, many of which are related to glutamatergic neurotransmission and signaling. So, while no genome-wide significant associations were found in the entire sample, the convergence of results from both the trio and combined trio-case-control analyses suggest the possibility that our findings at BTBD3, FAIM2 and ADCY8 are genes involved in the pathogenesis of OCD. In the case-control sample, the two most significant p-values were located within DLGAP1, a member of the same gene family as DLGAP3, which is also expressed in the neuronal postsynaptic density complex and which has been implicated in a mouse model of OCD, making these results intriguing.
