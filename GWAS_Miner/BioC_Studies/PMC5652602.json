variation across the allele frequency spectrum, we conducted a meta-analysis of genome-wide association data from 26,676 T2D case and 132,532 control subjects of European ancestry after imputation using the 1000 Genomes multiethnic reference panel. Promising association signals were followed up in additional data sets (of 14,545 or 7,397 T2D case and 38,994 or 71,604 control subjects). We identified 13 novel T2D-associated loci (P < 5 x 10-8), including variants near the GLP2R, GIP, and HLA-DQA1 genes. Our analysis brought the total number of independent T2D associations to 128 distinct signals at 113 loci. Despite substantially increased sample size and more complete coverage of low-frequency variation, all novel associations were driven by common single nucleotide variants. Credible sets of potentially causal variants were generally larger than those based on imputation with earlier reference panels, consistent with resolution of causal signals to common risk haplotypes. Stratification of T2D-associated loci based on T2D-related quantitative trait associations revealed tissue-specific enrichment of regulatory annotations in pancreatic islet enhancers for loci influencing insulin secretion and in adipocytes, monocytes, and hepatocytes for insulin action-associated loci. These findings highlight the predominant role played by common variants of modest effect and the diversity of biological mechanisms influencing T2D pathophysiology.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 1585, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "Introduction", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 1598, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Type 2 diabetes (T2D) has rapidly increased in prevalence in recent years and represents a major component of the global disease burden. Previous efforts to use genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to characterize the genetic component of T2D risk have largely focused on common variants (minor allele frequency [MAF] >5%). These studies have identified close to 100 loci, almost all of them currently defined by common alleles associated with modest (typically 5-20%) increases in T2D risk. Direct sequencing of whole genomes or exomes offers the most comprehensive approach for extending discovery efforts to the detection of low-frequency (0.5% < MAF < 5%) and rare (MAF <0.5%) risk and protective alleles, some of which might have greater impact on individual predisposition. However, extensive sequencing has thus far been limited to relatively small sample sizes (at most, a few thousand cases), restricting power to detect rarer risk alleles even if they are of large effect. Although evidence of rare variant associations has been detected in some candidate gene studies, the largest study to date, involving exome sequencing in ~13,000 subjects, found little trace of rare variant association effects.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 2815, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Here, we implement a complementary strategy that makes use of imputation into existing GWAS samples from the DIAbetes Genetics Replication And Meta-analysis (DIAGRAM) Consortium with sequence-based reference panels.
