To follow-up on these findings, and try to identify novel colorectal cancer susceptibility loci, we present results for genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of colorectal cancer (2,906 cases, 3,416 controls) that have not previously published main associations. Specifically, we calculated odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using log-additive models for each study. In order to improve our power to detect novel colorectal cancer susceptibility loci, we performed a meta-analysis combining the results across studies. We selected the most statistically significant single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for replication using 10 independent studies (8,161 cases and 9,101 controls). We again used a meta-analysis to summarize results for the replication studies alone, and for a combined analysis of GWAS and replication studies. We measured 10 SNPs previously identified in colorectal cancer susceptibility loci and found eight to be associated with colorectal cancer (p-value range: 0.02 to 1.8 x 10-8).

When excluding studies that have previously published results on these known loci, five loci showed evidence of replication in this independent subsample. The 8q24 SNP rs6983267 has already been heavily studied, including published reports for many of the studies included in this paper (;), so we were not able to examine independent replication of this SNP in this study. Among the remaining four loci that did not show a significant association at p<0.05, three showed a trend towards replication (with p<0.2 and an odds ratio in the same direction as the original GWAS report). However, one SNP, rs10795668, did not show any evidence for association with disease (OR=1.00; 95% CI: 0.93-1.08; p=0.96; Supplemental Figure 2). Several papers have reviewed potential reasons for the lack of replication of GWAS findings (;). As in any observational study, it is possible this represents either a false positive in the initial report, or a false negative in this replication; although that seems unlikely since both the discovery GWAS and this report are based on large, well-powered studies. We used the same genetic model and similar trait definitions as the discovery GWAS. Further, all studies were restricted to non-Hispanic Whites, limiting the possibility of differences in linkage disequilibrium patterns. It is possible that there may be differences in the distribution of a key effect modifier between the studies used to identify rs10795668 and the studies presented in this paper. A full exploration of underlying gene-gene or gene-environment interactions is beyond the scope of the current paper, but we did explore if the effect of rs10795668 varied by sex. Although the results were not significant for either sex, and the 95% CIs overlap, we do note an interesting pattern where the odds ratios are in opposite directions for women and men, with men showing a trend in the direction of the discovery GWAS.

However, the prediction of each of these amino acid changes is proposed to be benign. Overall, our finding provides additional independent support that this variant is associated with susceptibility to colorectal cancer.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 13481, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "None of the loci were significantly associated with colorectal cancer in our replication study after adjusting for multiple testing (0.05/321=1.6 x 10-4), and none of the loci reached \"genome-wide significance\" at the suggested p-values of 1.6 x 10-7 after accounting for the two-stage design (details see method section) (;;;;;). However, for some of the variants with p<0.05 in our replication and combined p-value <10-4, additional lines of evidence provide support for the hypothesis that we may have identified genomic regions harboring causal variants for colorectal cancer susceptibility. The variant rs4813802 is about 295.3kb centromeric to the previously identified rs961253/BMP2 GWAS hit; both statistical models and LD data support the idea that these are independent signals. The closest gene is bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP2). The new variant of interest, rs4813802, is closer to BMP2 (49.2kb upstream) than the previously identified SNP rs961253 (344.5kb upstream of BMP2). Interestingly, rs4813802 lies within an ENCODE Digital DNAseI Hypersensitivity Cluster; it is also within an ENCODE region showing H3K4Me1 enhancer associated histone marks, and the flanking 15 bp show strong placental mammal conservation by PhastCons. While not conclusive, all of these are consistent with the region flanking the SNP acting as a long-range enhancer element, plausibly for BMP2. The BMP2 gene belongs to the transforming growth factor-beta (TGFbeta) superfamily, which plays an important role in cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. SNPs in five out of the 10 known colorectal cancer SNPs have chromosomal locations in or near TGFbeta superfamily genes. Furthermore, loss in BMP signaling has been reported at the transition from advanced adenoma to early cancer stage, compatible with a role in tumor progression. Support for a role for BMP signaling in colorectal cancer comes from the identification of mutations in the bone morphogenetic protein receptor, type IA protein (BMPR1A) in juvenile polyposis. Individuals with familial juvenile polyposis have a 20% risk of colon cancer by age 35 and 68% by age 60. Our finding supports the possibility of allelic heterogeneity at the BMP2 locus, which is consistent with findings for the 8q24 cancer locus (;) and recent findings for height showing evidence for allelic heterogeneity at as many as 19 loci. Similar to our finding, these 19 secondary signals in height were rather distant (on average 177kb) from the initial index SNP that was found to be associated through GWAS. Accordingly, a comprehensive exploration of already discovered colorectal cancer loci may uncover additional independent variants. However, this example demonstrates that defining the boundaries of a susceptibility locus may be challenging, because the SNP we identified (rs4813802) would not have been included if we had defined the region around the initial index SNP (rs961253) by LD.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 16431, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The 8q24 region has been shown to have multiple independent variants that are associated with cancers. Several of these variants are associated with more than one cancer, and some cancers are associated with multiple variants in this region (;). Similarly, multiple variants associated with various cancer sites, including cancers of lung, pancreas, testes, and bladder, as well as glioma, basal cell carcinoma, and melanoma are found in the TERT-CLPTM1L region (Figure 2) (;;;;;;;;;). Ours is the first report suggesting that a variant in the TERT-CLPTM1L region could be associated with colorectal cancer. The variant rs2853668 is 4.9kb upstream of telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) and 18.0kb downstream of cleft lip and palate transmembrane protein 1-like protein (CLPTM1L). Both genes have been implicated in cancer: CLPTM1L has been shown to be altered in cisplatin-resistant cell lines and potentially impacts apoptosis; TERT encodes for the telomerase catalytic subunit that is important for the replication and stabilization of telomere ends, and subsequently impacts chromosome replication and suppression of cell senescence. Malfunction of telomerase can result in chromosomal abnormality and subsequent tumor formation. Our finding provides further evidence that TERT-CLPTM1L is a general cancer susceptibility locus that impacts critical function for cancer development, similar to the 8q24 region. The candidate gene in the 8q24 loci is MYC, and, as noted by Johnatty and colleagues, these two loci could act in concert. Specifically, the TERT promoter has several MYC (the nearest gene to the 8q24 locus) binding sites; however, we did not observe a statistically significant interaction between rs2853668/TERT-CLPTM1L and rs6983267/8q24, MYC (p for interaction term=0.8).", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 18225, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The SNP rs7315438, which showed the most statistically significant association in both the replication study alone, as well as in the combined meta-analysis of GWAS and replication studies, is located on chromosome 12q24 about 76.9kb upstream of the T-box 3 protein (TXB3). The SNP is also located 50.4kb downstream of MED13L, which encodes for a subunit of the mediator complex, a large complex of proteins that functions as a transcriptional coactivator for most RNA polymerase II-transcribed genes.

Other genes close to rs27545 are SRD5A1 (146 kb upstream), which converts testosterone into the more potent dihydrotestosterone, and the methyltransferase NSUN2 (183 kb downstream), which methylates tRNA.
