As well as being highly-expressed in the brain, retina and elsewhere, MTNR1B is transcribed in human islets and rodent insulinoma cell lines and the translated receptor is thought to mediate the inhibitory effect of melatonin on insulin secretion. Melatonin release is characterized by marked circadian variability and these inhibitory effects on insulin secretion may contribute to the entrainment of circadian patterns of insulin release. There is substantial evidence in human and rodent studies linking disturbances of circadian rhythmicity to metabolic conditions including diabetes and over-expression of melatonin receptors has been observed in islets from patients with T2D as compared to non-diabetic controls.

Thus, whilst the physiological regulation of FG set point and the pathological decline in beta-cell function which characterizes common forms of T2D generally appear to involve different processes, the MTNR1B finding suggests that this is not always the case.
