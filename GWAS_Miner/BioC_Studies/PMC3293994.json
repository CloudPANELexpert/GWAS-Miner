The DARC gene was of particular interest given the biologic plausibility of DARC as a modulator of the body's inflammatory response and literature suggesting a role for DARC in the development of asthma and IgE dysregulation. A recent study by Vergara et al investigated the relationship between DARC and asthma phenotypes in subjects of African descent. A SNP in the DARC promoter region, rs2814778, located in the same LD block as the top DARC SNP in FHS (http://www.broad.mit.edu.mpg/haploview), was found to be significantly associated with total IgE in Colombian and African Caribbean populations and with asthma in Colombian, Brazilian, and African Caribbean populations.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 21158, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Based on the HapMap CEPH sample, there is low to moderate LD between the highest associated SNP in DARC, rs13962, and the nearby top SNP in FCER1A (rs2251746) with r2 = 0.27. (Figure E1) (http://broad.mit.edu/mpg/snap) Conditional regression analysis, performed in FHS and the 5 independent replication cohorts, revealed that the association of DARC with total IgE concentration was not significant once rs2251746 was included in the model. While this suggests that the DARC association in the Vergara study may be confounded by the effect of the neighboring FCER1A gene, differences in the populations studied in this meta-analysis (predominantly Caucasian of European descent) and the Vergara study (African descent) likely play a role as the minor allele frequencies of the DARC SNP are significantly higher in populations of African descent compared to populations of European descent. Given the known function of the DARC receptor to act as a chemokine sink and modulate the inflammatory cascade, the DARC associations with asthma and total IgE remain plausible, particularly in African populations. Further studies to better delineate the roles of DARC and FCER1A in IgE dysregulation are warranted.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 22364, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Our study also confirmed, at a genome-wide significant level, the findings from prior genetic literature implicating FCER1A, STAT6, and IL13 as susceptibility loci for IgE dysregulation. In the first published GWAS of total IgE concentration, Weidinger and colleagues identified FCER1A as a susceptibility gene in a population based German cohort. The top FCER1A SNP in the Weidinger study, rs2427837, was also highly associated with total IgE in FHS and had the second lowest p-value among all top SNPs (p=9.82 x 10-12). STAT6 and IL-13 are known to play significant roles in the pathogenesis of IgE dysregulation. IL-13, in conjunction with IL-4, is a critical mediator of the TH2 allergic response and STAT6 is considered the master regulator of IgE class switch recombination. Our observation of a strong association of STAT6 SNPs with IgE concentration confirms previous linkage and candidate gene studies which have shown STAT6 genetic variants to be associated with food allergy, atopic dermatitis, asthma, and total IgE. In a recent review of asthma and atopy genetics, Ober and Hoffman identified IL-13 as one of 8 \"elite\" genes which had been associated with an asthma or atopy phenotype in greater than 10 studies.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 23595, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The RAD50 gene is located within 20 kb of IL-13 on chromosome 5. In the Weidinger study, as well as the subsequent GWAS investigating asthma by Li and colleagues, the RAD50 gene was found to be more highly associated with total IgE and asthma, respectively, than the neighboring IL-13 gene. This is in contrast to the FHS cohort in which SNPs located in IL-13 were found to have the strongest associations in the region, with no SNPs within the RAD50 gene found to have a p-value < 10-4 (see Figure E3). The highest associated SNPs in each (rs1295686 for IL-13, rs2240032 for RAD50) were in moderate LD with an r2=0.58 in the HapMap CEPH sample. Given the findings from three separate GWAS, it is difficult to separate the two signals on a genetic level. With mouse models showing a TH2 locus control region in the 3' end of RAD50,  both Il-13 and RAD50 are plausible candidate genes in the pathogenesis of IgE dysregulation and asthma.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 24534, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "In summary, this GWAS of plasma total IgE in the Framingham Heart Study has identified potential susceptibility loci in the HLA-A, HLA-G, HLA-DQA2 gene regions for which an association with total IgE has not been clearly established in the previous literature. We have also confirmed the associations of previously described genetic variants in FCER1A, STAT6, and IL-13 as risk factors for IgE dysregulation.
