All the 6 SNPs are eQTL sites to the target gene GREM2 in tibial artery and cultured primary fibroblast cell line from fresh skin, while the signals for the lead SNP rs1414660 are the most significant in both tissues (p=5.50x10-9 and 2.04x10-14).", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 19644, "infons": {"section_type": "RESULTS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "rs56346965 has 7 neighboring SNPs (rs2293765, rs1978273, rs2159819, rs11900804, rs2192008, rs4853727 and rs4853516) with strong LD patterns (r2>0.8).

Mismatched ancestry between the discovery and replication samples may have contributed to non-replicability for those non-replicated variants, because the discovery association signals might have been driven by the non-European samples. To check this possibility, we analyzed the discovery European samples separately.
