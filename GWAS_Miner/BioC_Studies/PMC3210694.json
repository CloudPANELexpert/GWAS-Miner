Genetic linkage studies and, most recently, the first generation of GWAS studies of alcoholic case-control series, have sought to identify genes contributing to risk of alcohol use disorder. In parallel, a second literature has developed, mostly based on twin studies, showing comparably high genetic variance in alcohol consumption patterns and noting genetic overlap between alcohol dependence and heaviness of consumption. This overlap persists even when consumption data from alcohol dependent individuals are omitted from the analysis, to avoid an artefactual correlation due to escalating consumption secondary to the onset of alcoholism. Studies of alcohol metabolism genes (ALDH2, ADH gene family), initially in Asian samples, and then in those of Jewish, European or African ancestry, have shown how genetic variants can make important contributions to differences in risk of alcohol dependence, consumption, or other aspects of response to alcohol.

SHANK2 is a scaffolding gene implicated in the formation of the postsynaptic density at glutamergic synapses, and there have been reports of rare SHANK2 variants overrepresented in cases of Autism Spectrum Disorder. For the remainder no obvious link with alcoholism risk can be identified. In no case do we have confidence that a true positive association has been identified; and because of small effect sizes, confirmation by the first generation of alcohol GWAS studies is not to be expected.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 24444, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "For alcoholism, published GWAS studies have been seriously underpowered so that accumulation of many more alcohol dependent cases with GWAS will be necessary. Our secondary analyses of current (12-month) alcohol consumption measures, which had effect sizes and p-values comparable to those for heaviest drinking period, also provide some limited grounds for hope that large scale cross-study analyses will ultimately be successful in identifying some of the variants that contribute to consumption differences, and thus indirectly to differences in dependence risk. Current though not heaviest period alcohol consumption measures will have been obtained in studies of many medical phenotypes as part of a dietary assessment (e.g. food frequency questionnaires,), albeit typically using truncated scales that do not well characterize individuals with highly elevated consumption levels, and in older age-groups whose consumption may have declined substantially from their heaviest drinking period. Still, accumulating such data on one hundred thousand or more individuals (necessary to detect effect sizes of the order of 0.001% [one tenth of one percent] of the variance with reasonable power) would be feasible. The immediate clinical value of identifying a number of very weakly but significantly associated variants by such an approach may be low, but identification of genes and pathways involved in individual variation in liability to alcohol use disorders could be great. Perhaps more narrowly defined consequences of alcohol effects (alcoholic liver disease; severe alcohol withdrawal) will give more hopeful outcomes. It is also possible however that work on genomic profiling, using random effects modeling of genomewide SNP data will point to new directions in biological psychiatry, yielding greater understanding of the genetic contributions to individual phenotypes and enabling better quantification of genetic risk, thereby overcoming one of the primary challenges in prospective research on high-risk groups, and in resilience research, namely the inability to achieve sharp differentiation of genetic risk between groups.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 26584, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "There are several limitations of this research. The low density coverage of the 370K array may have contributed to negative findings. While the family-structured sampling design that we have used remains powerful for quantitative phenotypes, this is achieved at the cost of a loss of power for alcohol dependence diagnosis: in a general community sample the majority of such cases will be mild, and cases and their unaffected siblings may differ only modestly, in terms of symptom count. Second, while the study at the time it was implemented was powerful, considering anticipated effect sizes, subsequent findings across many complex phenotypes suggests that it is seriously underpowered given effect sizes that are likely to emerge for alcohol consumption and dependence outcomes. Third, our strategy of relying upon convergence of findings across consumption and dependence phenotypes could cause us to miss associations that are specific to dependence. Finally, the cohorts that we have used in this research mostly were raised at a time of restrictive Australian divorce practices, so that even in families with parental alcoholism, it was usual for that parent to remain in the family. While this might increase effect size, through GxE interaction effects, it also requires confirmation of generalizability to more contemporary cohorts.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 27928, "infons": {"section_type": "SUPPL", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "Supplementary Material", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 27951, "infons": {"section_type": "SUPPL", "type": "footnote"}, "text": "This is a PDF file of an unedited manuscript that has been accepted for publication.
