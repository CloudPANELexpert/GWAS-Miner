Minor differences in study design may also have contributed to the observed differences in allele frequencies among cases and controls. Similar strategies were used for recruiting the cases at MSKCC, BCFR and NYUMC, selecting women with >=3 affecteds in a single lineage at MSKCC and NYUMC and women with an average 2.86 cases of breast cancer per family through BCFR, but control recruitment differed for the NYUMC dataset compared to the Discovery Phase groups. Women aged 60 years or older were selected to exclude the chance of an early breast cancer diagnosis. The MSKCC controls were not selected based on age, but controls used in the BCFR dataset were age-matched to the cases. Similarly, phase 2 of the original MSKCC study [10] did select age-matched controls but did not select cases based on family history, and phase 3 utilized sporadic breast cancer cases. Two SNPs (rs7203563 and rs3012642) were not significant in phase 3 of the original MSKCC study, but it is unclear if this is a result of the use of sporadic cases. The remaining 5 SNPs were validated in both of the MSKCC phase 2 and 3 datasets. In the current study it is most likely that sample size impacted the results observed in the BCFR and NYUMC datasets because the observed odds ratios are all similar to the MSKCC group. Indeed, in the 3 phases of the original MSKCC study p-value ranges vary with the size of the respective datasets: phase 1 [548 subjects, p-values=8.9x10-4 - 4.5x10-2], phase 2 [1929 subjects, p-values=9.8x10-5 - 3.3x10-3], and phase 3 [430 subjects, p-values= 1.8x10-2 - 0.57]. Pooled p-values were examined for the 3 datasets in our study, for a total of 1467 subjects, and the range was 1.70x10-6 - 4.10x10-2. Fisher meta p-value from p-values of the three independent cohorts was calculated and reported together with common measures of heterogeneity for meta analysis including Cochran's Q statistic and I2 statistic. Also, complete clinical data may reveal phenotypic subtype(s) with which some SNPs are more strongly associated.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 24788, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "To our knowledge, breast cancer risk models that do not incorporate BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations have not been previously attempted for the AJ population. Cases in our study groups are without BRCA1/2 mutations. To assess usefulness of the identified markers in predicting AJ familial breast cancer cases versus AJ controls, we constructed a preliminary model using the NYUMC group starting with14 markers: 7 new candidate SNPs, a gene score for FGFR2 and 6 previously identified SNPs. We arrived at a 7-marker panel in a stepwise manner, eliminating 7 of the 14 SNPs that were not significant in the multivariate model (p>0.05). More details on the construction of the multivariate logistic model can be found in the Data Analysis section. In short, the model based on the 7 markers achieved an AUC of 0.74 (95% CI: 0.69, 0.79). However, it is important to note that since the NYUMC cohort was used to evaluate discovery SNPs and to construct the risk model, the model is subject to some degree of over-fitting or overestimation of the predictability. For this reason, cross-validation of the model was performed revealing an AUC of 0.67 (95%CI: 0.62, 0.72).", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 25944, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "It is clear that many more SNPs of similar effect size will be required to predict familial breast cancer risk more accurately in AJ women.

It might also be valuable to test the Breast Cancer Risk Assessment Tool BCRAT data, based on age at menarche, age at first live birth, number of first-degree relatives with breast cancer, and number of previous benign breast biopsies, combined with this SNP panel. These clinical covariates have previously been shown with modest predictability for breast cancer risk [23]. Unfortunately, these covariates were not measured in this current study. Unlike the previous study, though, the NYUMC dataset was recruited to include controls without family histories of breast cancer.

Likewise, amplification of 6p22.3 has been linked to multiple cancers including bladder and hereditary prostate cancer. 18p11.22 has been linked to lung cancer and 5q13.2 deletions to chemoresistant ovarian tumors, colorectal cancer, and chondrosarcomas. However, we were unable to directly determine the specific biological relevance for these SNPs. GWAS SNP arrays were designed to detect common alleles with the assumption that they themselves are causal alleles or that they tag those that are. It is possible that the low-penetrance risk SNPs identified here are actually tagging causal high-penetrance mutations undetectable at this point due to low frequency and/or incomplete coverage of variants.

One limitation to this study is the relatively small sample size resulting in limited power to achieve genome-wide significance or replicate known variants. This limitation might be the main cause for the insignificance of the 27 previously identified breast cancer SNPs in the NYUMC cohort, many of which had reached genome-wide significance in other studies. As mentioned earlier, some of the SNPs found to be associated with breast cancer risk in different populations may not be replicable in the AJ population without BRCA1/2 mutations even with a larger sample size. Nonetheless, our goal for examining these previously published SNPs in the NYUMC cohort was to identify potential candidates that might be useful in the context of building multivariate risk prediction models. Another limitation was the incomplete coverage of variants on the SNP arrays available at the onset of the study, impeding the detection of rare and/or causal variants. Similarly, there was incomplete coverage of SNPs in the MSKCC dataset compared to the BCFR dataset due to the use of early-access versus commercially available Affymetrix 500K arrays. As a result, about 13% of the SNPs genotyped in the BCFR cohort were not genotyped in the MSKCC cohort. Since 111 SNPs were identified from the 435,632 genotyped SNPs (0.025%) we expect that successful imputation of the remaining SNPs in the MSKCC cohort would have resulted in an approximately additional 17 SNPs for further testing in the NYUMC cohort, 1 to 2 of which may have been of interest. As high-density genotyping data from next-generation sequencing for the AJ population becomes available, imputation for missing and untyped SNPs, as well as genotyping of rare and/or casual variants, will become more achievable. Finally, because we were already limited by sample size we did not divide the cohorts further by stage or histopathological subtype.
