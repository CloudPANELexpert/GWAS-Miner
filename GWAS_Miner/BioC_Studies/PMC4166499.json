Similarly, while our discovery sample included subjects from multiple ethnic groups, the likelihood that results are artifacts of population stratification is greatly reduced by several factors: 1) PCA-correction of the GWAS analysis resulted in no evidence of population stratification (lambdaGC=1.00); 2) results were replicated in an ethnically homogeneous German sample; 3) the overlapping obesity locus from general population GWAS studies has been replicated in African-ancestry populations.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 22571, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "It should be noted, however, that the GWAS signal for antipsychotic-induced weight gain is not precisely the same as that identified in general population studies. First, our genotypic effects followed a recessive pattern (Figure 3); heterozygotes did not substantially differ from common allele homozygotes. Moreover, no SNPs on any chromosome exceeded a statistical threshold of p<10-06 for analyses testing the dominant or additive models in our cohort. By contrast, GWAS effects reported in the general population literature are additive, with heterozygotes intermediate to the two homozygous groups. Second, while this genomic region is marked by considerable linkage disequilibrium with multiple SNPs achieving nominal associations in both our GWAS and general population studies of obesity, specific SNP effects differ. For example, a proxy for the strongest additive correlate of general population obesity was not amongst the top 20 recessive SNPs in our cohort, although it was nominally significant (see Table 1). Similarly, the SNP in our study (rs489693) has not emerged as the most strongly associated SNP in general population studies, except for a single study of waist circumference. Further research with larger samples will be needed to test for multiple, independent allelic effects at this locus, as has been reported in a recent study of obesity.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 23942, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Our results may inform the design of GWAS studies seeking to identify risk alleles for complex phenotypes, such as obesity, that are mediated by a plethora of genetic and environmental factors. In GWAS studies of weight, samples sizes in the thousands were necessary to achieve statistically significant results, presumably because of the vast numbers of unmeasured (and uncontrolled) environmental factors working over variable amounts of time to influence the ultimate weight phenotype. In the current study, the critical environmental factor predisposing individuals to weight gain was antipsychotic drug administration over a short period of time. The experimental control of this one factor provided us with sufficient environmental homogeneity to detect genome-wide significant results in a study of slightly more than one hundred, rather than thousands, of subjects. Future studies of complex phenotypes may benefit from consideration of pharmacological or other environmental \"challenge\" paradigms for the detection of susceptibility alleles.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 24997, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "These data have potential clinical implications. For example, a priori identification of those subjects at increased risk of severe weight gain could lead to alternative treatments other than SGAs - particularly in patients not suffering from an Axis I psychotic disorder. Of note, recent data from the 2007 National Ambulatory Medical Care survey indicate that antipsychotic drugs (most commonly quetiapine and risperidone) were prescribed in 21.3% of patient visits for anxiety disorders, with the largest increase in new patient visits, despite the fact that there is little evidence for these drugs's efficacy in anxiety. Therefore, it might be plausible to consider pharmacotherapeutic strategies that would not include antipsychotic drugs in those non-psychotic individuals who carry the high risk genotype for weight gain, as well as increased behavioral and psychosocial interventions focused on dietary and exercise habits. Finally, research on the co-administration of MC4R agonists, of which several are being developed, in this subset of patients could be informative for the development of ameliorative strategies.",
