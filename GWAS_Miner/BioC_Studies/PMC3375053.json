The heritability of schizophrenia is high, estimated in most studies to be approximately 80%. Despite this fact, the mechanisms underlying susceptibility to schizophrenia remain elusive, likely due to both the genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity of the disorder. The analysis of endophenotypes or 'intermediate' phenotypes has great potential to shed light on the genetic mechanisms underlying schizophrenia and other potentially related neuropsychiatric disorders, such as bipolar disorder. The power of this analytic strategy is derived from the observation that endophenotypes may reflect underlying pathologies more proximal to genetic lesions and may help create more homogenous subtypes of schizophrenia that are amenable to genetic analysis. Therefore, we pursued a genome-wide association study (GWAS) leveraging variation in an endophenotype derived from structural brain measures that is thought to reflect a component of pathogenetic processes leading to, or associated with, schizophrenia.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 3437, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Genetic association analyses focusing on the role of common DNA sequence variation and schizophrenia diagnosis without leveraging endophenotypes or an attempt to accommodate the likely heterogeneity associated with schizophrenia have been highly problematic.

In contrast, the use of endophenotypes has resulted in some successes. For example, candidate gene studies have identified SNP associations with both anatomical and functional brain measures, many of which can be considered intermediate phenotypes for schizophrenia. In addition, a recent GWAS identified SNPs associated with brain activation in schizophrenia. While these candidate gene associations require further replication, they support the claim that common genetic variation can be associated with neural intermediate phenotypes of relevance to schizophrenia.

In addition, rs4906844 is modestly associated with neurocognitive performance among subjects diagnosed with schizophrenia, likely due to variation in cortical thickness associated with this SNP.

Alternatively, rs4906844 may act earlier to reduce cortical thickness and contribute directly to schizophrenia onset because of the increased vulnerability of the brain to abnormal development. Various environmental challenges may contribute to this vulnerability, including living in an urban area or being an immigrant, both possible indicators of psychosocial adversity, as well as fetal risks. In either case, rs4906844 would be expected to show no association with cortical thickness in subjects without a schizophrenia diagnosis, and this is what we observe in this study.

As predicted, rs4906844 is significantly associated with nominally reduced performance on the vast majority of cognitive tests, and the SNP is nominally associated with decreased Total Repetition Errors on the D-KEFS Verbal Fluency Test.

For example, both the CVLT-II and D-KEFS tests make demands on verbal ability, and the Block Design measure of the WASI test is sensitive to deficits in visuospatial and motor skills.

LOC100128714 lies within the Prader-Willi and Angelman syndrome deletion region on chromosome 15q11-q13, and Prader-Willi syndrome is sometimes characterized by psychotic features, particularly in those subjects with maternal uniparental disomy of chromosome 15. Maternally-derived duplications of 15q11-13 may also be a rare risk factor for schizophrenia and related psychoses. LOC100128714 has the potential to regulate one of the many imprinted and non-imprinted genes at this locus (including proximal genes ATP10A, UBE3A, and GABRB3) that have been implicated in neurodevelopment and neuropsychiatric disease. For example, Ube3A has recently been implicated in regulating excitatory synapse development by targeting for degradation the synaptic proteins Arc and Ephexin5.
