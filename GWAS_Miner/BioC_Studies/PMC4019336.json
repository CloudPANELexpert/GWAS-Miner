This gene has been previously implicated in hypertension via converging evidence from fine-mapping of quantitative trait loci in rats and association and linkage analyses in humans, although ADAMTS16, did not emerge as a candidate in the recent large-scale GWAS for hypertension involving 200,000 individuals. ADAMTS16 is expressed in the adult brain, but has had limited biological characterization to date. In our study, SNPs with the strongest association signals in ADAMTS16 are intronic and do not have documented eQTL annotations in brain tissue or in lymphoblastoid cell lines leaving the functional implications of these SNPs unknown. Further biological and genetic studies are needed to understand the potential role of ADAMTS16 in functional impairment and resilience. Future analyses may also examine the genetic and phenotypic relationship between risk/resilience for functional impairment in the context of psychiatric disorders and other traits that may impact health-related quality of life, including personality traits (e.g.,), motivation (e.g.,), social-cognition (e.g.,), and neurocognitive functioning (e.g.,).", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 26873, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "After careful correction for multiple testing and gene clustering, there was no evidence of association for any of the KEGG pathways. Although there was an initial signal in autoimmune and inflammatory processes for PCS, follow-up analyses suggested that results were artifactually driven by a single signal within the interferon alpha gene cluster on chromosome 9. These results emphasize the importance of controlling for LD patterns in pathway analyses and suggest that, like the HLA region, the interferon alpha region on chromosome 9 can be problematic.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 27432, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Our results should be interpreted in the context of their limitations. First, based on the available sample size, we had >80% power to detect a locus explaining 2% or more of the variance in MCS or PCS scores. Our strongest result approached but did not exceed a genome-wide threshold of statistical significance. Thus, analyses in larger samples will be essential to clarify our findings. To our knowledge, there are no comparable psychiatric samples with functional impairment measures and GWAS data available. As a result, we could not attempt replication of these results or examine cross-sample correspondence via more advanced statistical genetic approaches (i.e., polygenic scoring,). Fortunately, there is an ongoing data collection effort aimed at examining genetic predictors of quality of life, the GENEQOL consortium, so future datasets with rich quality of life and genetic data will become available to examine correspondence with these results.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 28392, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Second, self-report measures are only one strategy among many for measuring functional status. Alternative measures include real-world outcomes (i.e., occupational status, residential status, educational attainment) and functional capacity (i.e., ability to perform real-world skills such as managing money, paying bills). Of note, our derived mental and physical functioning measure was significantly associated with employment status across the three disorders, after controlling for psychiatric symptom severity, supporting their relevance to real world outcomes. Recently, functional capacity, with an emphasis on performance-based testing, has been advanced as a candidate endophenotype for genetic studies of severe mental illness. Genetic investigations of alternative measures of functional impairment will be complementary to the current analyses and important for characterizing genetic effects on functional vulnerability/resilience in the context of psychopathology.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 29371, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Third, the psychiatric symptom measures were different across the three disorder samples which may have provided different degrees of control for psychiatric symptom severity across the disorders. To address this limitation, we chose clinician-rated scales with similar wording and scales wherever possible (see Supplementary Table 1). Moreover, mental functioning, as measured by the SF-12, was more difficult to distinguish from psychiatric symptom severity than physical functioning given the overlap of constructs, particularly with depressive features (i.e., fatigue, calmness, sadness).
