To date, no study has evaluated differences in the perception of asthma symptoms in pediatric and adult asthmatic patients. However, for patients with childhood asthma, it was reported that adolescents (13-18 years) were more accurate in perceiving symptoms than school-age children (6-12 years), and the accuracy for perceiving symptoms increased with age in children age 7 to 17 years. These findings showing that perception of asthma symptoms increases with age suggest that perceived symptomatic response to ICS treatment is also likely to differ between pediatric and adult asthmatic patients. In the present GWAS we found 3 SNPs showing significant associations with improvements in asthma symptom scores responding to ICSs in children from both the CAMP and CARE trials. However, these associations were not further replicated in adults from the ACRN and LOCCS trials, which suggest that there might be a specific genetic mechanism regulating symptom response in children that does not carry over to adults. Interestingly, exhaled nitric oxide (eNO) as an associated biomarker of pulmonary response to ICSs showed a similar phenomenon. eNO is a predictor of ICS response in a clinical trial with pediatric asthmatic patients (Characterizing Response to Leukotriene Receptor Antagonist and Inhaled Corticosteroids [CLIC] study) but not in a clinical trial with adult asthmatic patients (Predicting Response to Inhaled Corticosteroid Efficacy [PRICE] study).

Although inconclusive, the results indicate that FBXL7 is coexpressed with HIF1A and therefore might directly or indirectly interact with HIF-1alpha. The regulation of HIF-1alpha by FBXL7 might partly account for child-specific symptomatic responses because it was suggested that dyspnea perception might be influenced by age, like pain perception. In addition, ubiquitination of inducible nitric oxide synthase was required for its degradation, and FBXO45, a member of the F-box protein family, was identified as a novel and direct nitric oxide synthase 2 interactor in human airway epithelial cells.
