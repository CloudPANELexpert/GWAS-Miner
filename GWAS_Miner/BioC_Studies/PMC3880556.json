It is likely that genes influencing these disorders comprise a combination of disorder-specific and shared susceptibility loci. Similar evidence for cross-disorder genetic effects have emerged from GWAS studies of other medical disorders, most notably autoimmune diseases where specific genetic markers are strongly associated with multiple, clinically distinctive conditions. For example, nearly half of the risk alleles identified as influencing either Type 1 diabetes or celiac disease have been shown to influence both disorders.

First, given the available sample size, our study had limited power to detect modest genetic effects or rare susceptibility variants using a strict genomewide threshold for significance. Because this is the first report of its kind and the goal was to characterize genotype-phenotype relationships, we present results down to a threshold of p < 5 x 10-5 to inform future analyses. Although our study detected only one region exceeding genomewide significant thresholds, recent pooled analyses of GWAS data have demonstrated that many variants that fall short of this threshold in a single study emerge as confirmed susceptibility loci when additional datasets are analyzed. Thus, the \"top hits\" in our study provide preliminary evidence that awaits replication in future studies. A large-scale effort to use genomewide data to dissect within-disorder and cross-disorder influences has begun through the Psychiatric GWAS Consortium. Our results may inform these analyses which ultimately may include GWAS data on > 80,000 individuals across five disorders: SCZ, BPD, MDD, autism, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 23394, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "A second limitation is that, by design, our model fitting approach did not involve statistical testing of the each model vs. the null hypothesis.

However, since the \"true\" model is unknown a priori, we would have to test multiple models to cover the range of possible true models.
