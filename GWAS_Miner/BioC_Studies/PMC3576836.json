However, it is known that multicollinearity of the predictors can inflate significance levels in regression analysis. Therefore, to check our results, for each SNP pair given in Tables 1 and 2, we used the software PHASE, version 2.1 to infer the haplotypes and found that, with few exceptions, only three of the four possible haplotypes were present; in all but one of these exceptions the fourth haplotype was rare in both cases and controls. We excluded those rare haplotypes (the largest excluded total count being 12, five cases and seven controls), and then the smallest expected value (on the assumption of no association between haplotypes and disease status) was 11.47 haplotypes. Furthermore, in all but two of the fifteen SNP pair tables, the expected haplotype count was always >15, so for these there is no reason to doubt the validity of the P value based on asymptotic assumptions. For the two tables for which the smallest expected value was <15, we calculated P values by Fisher's exact test, two-sided because the association could have been with risk or protection, then multiplied by four because the associated haplotype could have been any one of the four haplotypes. The P values for these extreme cases were within 1-2 orders of magnitude of those based on asymptotic assumptions; therefore, we believe the increased evidence for association to be valid and due to real haplotype effects rather than an artifact as a result of either multicollinearity or small sample numbers (actual haplotype counts and odds ratios are presented in supplemental material, Table 3).", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 20001, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Furthermore, for both CAD and HTN, the 3 df two-marker model, containing the addition of a cross-product term, yielded roughly the same SNP pairs with a P value of <5 x 10-7 as the 2 df purely additive model.

Both models gave similar P values, even though we were expecting the 3 df test to yield more significant association because of the additional cross-product term. In all but the above case, the extra term in the 3 df test proved to not be statistically significant (supplemental material, Table 2). The reason for this appears to be that in the situation where two disease flanking heterozygote genotypes are called, only four diplotypes are possible instead of the prior 16 possible diplotypes (Fig. 2), yielding two-locus phased genotype (diplotype) information. Therefore, the SNP pair becomes more informative and hence the association with disease would be less likely to be due to chance alone:regardless of any additional effect of the cross-product term.

If multiple SNP pairs showed significant association with a P value <5 x 10-7, only the lowest P value pair is shown. Mean allele frequency (MAF) refers to the MAF of SNP 1 and SNP 2, respectively. The associated risk (R) or protective (P) haplotypes (Hap) are given. Correlation (R\n2) and linkage disequilibrium (D') values for the individual SNP pairs are listed by their respective chromosome (Ch). The \"Pairs\" column displays the number of SNP pairs in the area with a P value <5 x 10-7. Please refer to the text for specific information on the HTN linking literature. Italics indicate genes. The (?) symbol is used for the SNP pair on chromosome (ch) 8, as NOV, which is 70 kb away from the associated SNP pair and has HTN linking literature", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}], "annotations": [], "relations": []}]}
