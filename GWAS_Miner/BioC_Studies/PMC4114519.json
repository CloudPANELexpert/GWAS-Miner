In AIDS Clinical Trials Group protocol 384, antiretroviral-naive patients were randomized to d4T/didanosine (ddI)- or zidovudine/lamivudine-containing regimens.

The interleukin-2 receptor alpha (IL2RA) gene encodes a regulator of immune responses (Maier et al.) but has no clear relevance to neuronal physiology. In Black patients with grade 3 peripheral neuropathy, the polymorphism with the lowest P value was in ZNF648, which may be involved in transcriptional regulation. In Hispanic patients with grade >=2 peripheral neuropathy, the polymorphism with the lowest P value was near RSPO4 (which encodes R-spondin 4, possibly involved in Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathways) (Blaydon et al.) and ANGPT4 (which encodes angiopoietin 4, involved in vascular development and angiogenesis) (Olsen et al.), genes with no specific relevance to neuronal physiology.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 14165, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "In analyses limited to neuropathy-associated genes, a meta-analysis considering all grades of peripheral neuropathy showed the lowest P value for a polymorphism in FGD4.

Meta-analysis of grade 3 peripheral neuropathy showed the lowest P value for a polymorphism near KIF1B. In White patients, the polymorphism with the lowest P value for association with all grades of peripheral neuropathy and with grade 3 peripheral neuropathy was in KIF1A, while in Black patients, the lowest P values were for polymorphisms in LITAF. KIF1A encodes a protein involved in anterograde transport of organelles along axonal microtubules, and KIF1A mutations have been associated with spastic paraplegia and hereditary sensory neuropathy (Klebe et al.; Riviere et al.), while KIF1B encodes for a protein involved in apoptosis and axonal transport of membranous organelles. Mutations to KIF family genes have been associated with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2A, while LITAF mutations have been associated with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1C (CMT1C) (Street et al.).
