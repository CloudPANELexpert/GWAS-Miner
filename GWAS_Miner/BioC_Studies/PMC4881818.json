The true extent of sharing is difficult to characterize because the sizes of non-European cohorts are often much smaller than their European counterparts, limiting power to detect associated loci. Despite our study including a large cohort of 9,846 non-European samples and being the largest non-European study of IBD, this number is still small in comparison with the European cohort of 86,640 individuals. As such, we expect that the majority of known risk loci will not be associated in the non-European populations at genome-wide significance. Nevertheless, we observed a striking positive correlation in direction of effect when comparing the 231 independently associated SNPs in European and East Asian cohorts, (P < 1.0x10-22 for Crohn's disease and P < 1.0x10-31 for ulcerative colitis) (Figure 1). Furthermore, of 3,900 suggestively associated SNPs (5x10-5<= P < 5x10-8) from the European-only IBD association analysis, 2,566 have the same direction of effect in the East Asian analysis (P = 5.92x10-88). Consistent with the concordant direction of effect at associated SNPs, there was high genetic correlation (rG) between the European and East Asian cohort when considering the additive effects of all SNPs genotyped on the Immunochip (Crohn's disease rG = 0.76, ulcerative colitis rG = 0.79 ) (Supplementary Table 11). Given that rare SNPs (minor allele frequency (MAF) < 1%) are more likely to be population-specific, these high rG values also support the notion that the majority of causal variants are common (MAF>5%). Although the Indian and Iranian cohort sizes are small compared to the East Asian cohort we observed similar trends for homogeneity of ORs at associated loci (Supplementary Figure 9 and 10) and high genetic correlation Immunochip-wide (Supplementary Table 11). Together with the strong effect size correlations at known risk loci, these results indicate that the majority IBD risk loci are shared across ancestral populations. Therefore, ancestry matched groups of IBD cases and controls can be combined across divergent populations to amass the large sample sizes needed to detect further disease associated loci.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 15055, "infons": {"section_type": "RESULTS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Not all IBD risk loci are shared across populations, as evidence by rG being significantly less than 1 (P < 8.2x10-4) for all pairwise population comparisons. In most cases, apparent differences in genetic risk are explained by different allele frequencies across populations. For instance, consistent with previous genetic studies of Crohn's disease in East Asians, the three coding variants in NOD2 (nucleotide-binding oligomerisation domain-containing protein 2) that have a large effect on IBD risk in Europeans (ORs = 2.13 to 3.03) have a risk-allele frequency (RAF) of zero in East Asians. Beyond these three coding variants, there is also evidence of at least four additional low-frequency independent NOD2 variants on the Immunochip that are associated with Crohn's disease in Europeans (HH, personal communication). In the East Asian cohort, two of these had a RAF of zero, while we were not powered to detect association at the other two because we observed less than four copies of the risk allele (MAF < 0.0004). Furthermore, no SNP within NOD2 achieved even suggestive evidence of association in the East Asian cohort (all P > 7.18x10-4). Larger sample sizes and a more complete ascertainment of variants (particularly in non-European cohorts) will be required to better assess the genetic architecture of NOD2 across divergent populations. Similarly, at the IL23R (interleukin 23 receptor) gene, previous studies have shown that there is substantial genetic heterogeneity between European and East Asian individuals in IBD risk. In line with these observations, the IL23R SNP with the largest effect in European Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis (rs80174646) has a RAF of one in East Asians, while secondary IL23R variants observed in Europeans were also not significantly associated with disease (rs6588248, P = 0.65; rs7517847, P = 0.04). These two secondary variants are common in East Asians (rs6588248, MAF = 0.39; rs7517847, MAF = 0.42) and, assuming the effect sizes observed in Europeans, we have 100% power to detect association to rs7517847 at P < 5x10-8 but only 84% power to detect association to rs6588248 at P< 0.05. Therefore, we cannot rule out the possibility that rs6588248 is involved in Crohn's disease susceptibility in East Asia. Both variants show significant heterogeneity of effect between the European and East Asian Crohn's disease cohorts (P < 2.44x10-4). However, IL23R clearly plays a role in East Asian IBD, evidenced by the association at rs76418789 with both Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis in East Asians (IBD P = 1.83x10-13). The same variant was previously implicated in a GWAS of Crohn's disease in Koreans (Supplementary Table 6). This variant, which has a much lower allele frequency in Europeans (MAF=0.004) than East Asians (MAF=0.07), demonstrates suggestive evidence of association in European IBD (P = 3.99x10-6, OR = 0.66), and becomes genome-wide significant (P = 2.31x10-10, OR = 0.53) after conditioning on the three known European risk variants (rs11209026, rs6588248 and rs7517847).", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 18123, "infons": {"section_type": "RESULTS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "We were well powered to detect genetic heterogeneity between our East Asian and European cohorts at several alleles of large effect in Europeans.

The variant shows no evidence of association in East Asians (P = 0.21), driven at least in part by a significant difference in allele frequency (RAF = 0.24, Fst = 0.15). However, assuming the effect size at this SNP in the East Asian cohort was equal to that seen in the European cohort, we would still have more than 80% power to detect suggestive evidence of association (P<5x10-5). In addition to differences in allele frequency we also observe evidence of heterogeneity of odds at this SNP (OREA = 1.06; P = 8.45x10-4). The previously reported lead SNP at the IRGM locus in Europeans also shows only nominally significant evidence of association in East Asian Crohn's disease (rs11741861, European P = 5.89x10-44, East Asian P = 2.62x10-3) as well as evidence of heterogeneity of effect (European OR = 1.33 vs. East Asian OR = 1.13; heterogeneity P = 1.20x10-3).

Overall our data showed some demographic differences between the European and non-European populations with a male predominance in Crohn's disease (67% of non-European Crohn's disease patients are male compared to 45% in Europeans, P=7.09 x 10-78).

Our analyses suggest that significant differences in effect size are minimal at all but a handful of associated loci, further indicating that trans-ethnic association studies represent a powerful means of identifying new loci in complex diseases like IBD. Furthermore, the near complete sharing of genetic risk among individuals of diverse ancestry has significant consequences for association studies and disease risk prediction in non-European populations. Firstly, a significant association in one population makes the locus in question a very strong candidate for involvement in IBD risk worldwide. Secondly, our data suggest that ORs estimated from a very large association study are likely to better represent the effect size of the associated variants in a second, ancestrally diverse population, than those estimated from a significantly smaller study in the second population itself (because of the larger sampling variance in the second study). Finally, because rare alleles are more likely than common variants to be population specific, the significant number of IBD risk loci shared across ancestral populations implies that the underlying causal variants at these loci are common.

Therefore it is possible that causal variants could remain untyped, even within the dense 'fine-mapping' regions of Immunochip, and the chances of this occuring are greater still in populations of non-European ancestry. Until the causal variants that underlie these associated loci have been identified (or all SNPs within these loci are included in our association tests) we cannot rule out the possibility that differential tagging of untyped causal variants is driving the observed heterogeneity of effect.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 25588, "infons": {"section_type": "RESULTS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "In summary, we have performed the first trans-ethnic association study of IBD and identified 38 risk loci, raising the number of known IBD risk loci to 200.

The majority of these loci are shared across diverse ancestry groups, with only a handful of demonstrating population specific effects driven by heterogeneity in risk allele frequency (e.g. NOD2) or effect size (e.g. TNFSF15/TNFSF8). Concordance in direction of effect is significantly enriched among SNPs demonstrating only suggestive evidence of association, indicating that larger transethnic association studies represent a powerful means of identifying more IBD risk loci.

The proportion of variance explained by each associated locus per population was calculated using a liability threshold model assuming a disease prevalence of 500 per 100,000 and log-additive disease risk.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 45842, "infons": {"section_type": "METHODS", "type": "title_3"}, "text": "Genetic correlations", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 45863, "infons": {"section_type": "METHODS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The proportion of genetic variation tagged by Immunochip SNPs that is shared between European and each non-European cohort (rG) was estimated using the bivariate linear mixed-effects model implemented in GCTA.The method was applied across Immunochip individuals for each European vs. non-European pairwise comparison for Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, with 20 PCs as covariates and assuming a disease prevalence of 0.005. To test whether rG is significantly different from 0 (or 1), rG was fixed at 0 (or 1) and a likelihood ratio test comparing this constrained model with the unconstrained model was applied. An rG of 0 means that no genetic variants are shared between the two populations, while a value of 1 means that all the genetic variance tagged in one population is shared with the other.
