Nevertheless, patient survival times are variable and only partially explained by traditional clinical and pathologic features. Accumulating evidence indicates that germline genetic variability can provide important prognostic information for patients with cancer. One mechanism by which germline genetic variability may impact patient survival is through modification of tumor-host interactions. A defining feature of pancreatic adenocarcinoma is the recruitment of host cells, including fibroblasts, immune cells, and endothelial cells, which surround the tumor in a dense stromal matrix. This host-derived desmoplastic stroma actively engages with tumor cells and plays a critical role in promoting tumor development and progression. Notably, laboratory studies suggest that treatments which modify the interaction of pancreatic cancer cells with its surrounding stroma can impact survival in genetically engineered mouse models of pancreatic adenocarcinoma.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 2949, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Prior studies of germline variants and pancreatic cancer survival have primarily focused on the evaluation of candidate genes in pathways of suspected importance.

This gene encodes for a protein in the myotubularin family of lipid phosphatases and is also known as myotubularin-related protein-13 (MTMR13). Similar to the known tumor suppressor gene phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), MTMR proteins function as phosphoinositide- 3-phosphatases and antagonize the activity of specific classes of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases. Although it contains an inactive phosphatase domain, SBF2 enhances the catalytic activity of and may alter the cellular localization of MTMR2, a phosphatase-competent member of the MTMR family.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 20801, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Notably, mutations in either SBF2 or MTMR2 lead to the development of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 4B (CMT4B), an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by severe demyelinating peripheral neuropathy. The known mutations in human SBF2 lead to a shortened or truncated protein, and mice genetically engineered for loss of murine SBF2 develop peripheral neuropathy similar to that seen in humans with CMT4B. The pathogenic mechanisms appear related to altered membrane trafficking of 3-phosphoinositides within nerve-supporting Schwann cells, due to malfunctioning of the SBF2-MTMR2 complex. Importantly, in other cell types, SBF2 and MTMR2 appear to influence the sorting and degradation of cell surface receptors, such as the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), with resultant alterations in downstream signaling. For the SNPs identified in SBF2 in the current study, we did not identify alterations in expression of SBF2 or nearby genes using a publically available eQTL database. Further investigation will be necessary to determine the causative one or more SNPs marked by the single nucleotide changes identified in the current study, and the functional impact of such changes.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 21995, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Recently, two genome wide association studies have implicated SBF2 as a susceptibility locus for circulating lipoproteins in European populations and human stature in European and Chinese populations. The most strongly associated SNPs from these studies were rs7938647 with circulating HDL and rs10734652 with stature, also located within introns of SBF2. The most strongly associated SNP in our combined analysis, rs10500715, is in moderate linkage disequilibrium with rs7938647 and rs10734652, with r2 values of 0.40 and 0.56, respectively in the PanScan cohort.

Furthermore, the genes at these loci, chromosome 18 open reading frame 1 (C18orf1) and immunoglobin superfamily member 21 (IGSF21), respectively, encode for proteins with unclear function.

In the PanScan population, large numbers of cohort participants provided germline DNA at a baseline time point and were then followed prospectively for development of disease. Pancreatic cancer diagnoses were subsequently determined from notification near the time of diagnosis or review of cancer and death registries. Therefore, the full spectrum of cases were ascertained, in terms of disease aggressiveness and stage of disease, rather than only those patients well enough to be captured in case-controls studies. This is of particular importance to studies of rapidly fatal diseases, such as pancreatic cancer, in which a better-prognosis population can result when subjects donate biologic samples after diagnosis. Furthermore, our study included a large number of pancreatic cancer cases with genome-wide SNP data, and these data originated from two well-established GWAS with strict quality control procedures. We also pursued a two-stage design, with an initial analysis in PanScan participants and a subsequent combined analysis with ChinaPC participants, in an attempt to reduce the likelihood of false positive results.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 24526, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Our study also has limitations. Among our participants, treatment programs likely varied, and we could not control for differences in treatment as the PanScan cohorts generally did not collect this information. Nevertheless, chemotherapy and radiation have had only a modest impact on patient survival, and it is highly unlikely that treatment programs varied systematically by germline genotype. As described, we also performed combined analyses with a second group of pancreatic cancer cases, drawn from a case-control study in China, to reduce the chance of false positive results. However, linkage disequilibrium differs between Europeans and Asians, which can lead to false negative results in analyses that combine subjects of different race/ethnicity. Specifically, some loci may impact survival only in a particular race/ethnicity or the index signal may be best tagged by different polymorphisms in subjects of different race/ethnicity; phenomena demonstrated in studies of cancer risk. The difference in study design (nested prospective cohort study versus hospital-based case-control study) can also lead to false negative results in combined analyses due to recruitment of patients with dissimilar disease characteristics. However, all patients were known to have pancreatic adenocarcinoma, and all had available information on disease stage. Our top SNPs had significance levels of P<5x10-7; further studies are necessary to replicate these findings in additional large patient cohorts. As is inherent in the GWAS design, we have identified loci associated with pancreatic cancer survival, but further work is necessary to investigate the biologic mechanisms by which polymorphisms at these loci impact survival. Although we examined published eQTL datasets, we did not identify known gene expression changes related to the most significant SNPs in SBF2. Finally, we utilized overall mortality data in our analyses, as opposed to pancreatic cancer-specific mortality. However, pancreatic cancer is a highly lethal malignancy with cure rate less than five percent, such that overall mortality is a good surrogate for cancer-specific mortality in patients with this disease.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 26715, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "In summary, we performed a genome-wide analysis of germline genetic variants and survival of patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma.
