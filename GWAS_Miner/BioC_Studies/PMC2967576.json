It generally occurs in the context of obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus and dyslipidemia. It is broadly categorized into steatosis, which is largely benign and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), which can progress to cirrhosis and liver failure. The pathogenesis of NASH is not well understood. It remains unclear why some patients with NAFLD exhibit NASH, whereas patients with same set of co-morbidities and known risk factors have fatty liver only. There are data to provide evidence that genetic factors play an important role in the pathogenesis of and disease progression in NAFLD. Studies have shown that there is familial clustering of NAFLD, and in fact it is highly heritable. Schwimmer et al. have estimated that the heritability of liver fat fraction (assessed by magnetic resonance [MR] spectroscopy) as a continuous trait after controlling for age, gender, race and BMI was 39%. There is a striking ethnic variability in the prevalence of NAFLD, even after controlling for confounding risk factors. In the Dallas Heart Study where MR spectroscopy was performed on 2,287 multiethnic adults, Hispanics had significantly higher and Blacks had significantly lower prevalence of hepatic steatosis, in comparison to whites. Despite this strong suspicion and suggestive data, studies evaluating the genetic basis for NAFLD and NASH are limited. Most studies have been hypothesis-driven and have tested candidate genes in relevant pathways such as hepatic free fatty acid load, oxidative stress, response to endotoxin, release or effect of adipocytokines, and severity of hepatic fibrosis. Many of these studies have undoubtedly yielded interesting and important results but they have generally suffered from small sample size and insufficient statistical power.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 3917, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) provide a broader and unbiased approach for discovery of genes involved in complex genetic traits. For example, the association between complement factor H gene and macular degeneration, TNFSF15 conferring susceptibility to Crohn's disease, and association of coronary heart disease with loci near the CDKN2A and CDKN2B genes on chromosome 9 were all identified through GWAS. But GWAS with any pertinence to NAFLD are quite limited, and none have been performed in patients with histologically characterized NAFLD. In one study, Yuan et al. conducted a GWAS of plasma liver-enzyme levels in three populations with replication in three additional cohorts. The previously reported associations between the GGT1 locus and gamma glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) levels and between the ABO locus and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) levels were confirmed. In addition, CPN1-ERLIN1-CHUK on chromosome 10 and PNPLA3-SAMM50 on chromosome 22 were found to influence plasma levels of alanineaminotransferase (ALT), HNF1A on chromosome 12 influenced GGT levels, and three loci influenced ALP levels (ALPL on chromosome 1, GPLD1 on chromosome 6, and JMJD1C-REEP3 on chromosome 10). In a more recent study, Romeo et al reported the relationship between genome-wide survey of 9,229 nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and hepatic fat detected by MR spectroscopy in 1,032 African-American, 696 European-American and 383 Hispanic adults residing in Dallas County. This study found that variation in PNPLA3 contributes to ethnic and inter-individual differences in hepatic fat content and susceptibility to NAFLD. An allele in PNPLA3 (rs738409; I148M) was strongly associated with increased hepatic fat levels (P=5.9x10-10) and with alanine aminotransferase levels (P=3.7x10-4).

In addition, each sample was assessed for the presence or absence of NASH by pattern recognition and for the NAFLD Activity Score (NAS) which is the sum of steatosis, inflammation and hepatocyte ballooning. Additionally, all eligible subjects had liver biopsy within 6-months prior to their enrollment into the NAFLD Database Study. The NAFLD Database Study was reviewed and approved by all participating clinical centers and the data coordinating center, and all participants signed an informed consent which included specific approval for genetic studies.

Although type 1, 3 and 4 collagen production has been linked to hepatic fibrogenesis, the association between collagen type 13 and liver disease has not been previously reported. The COL13A1 gene is linked to intestinal inflammatory response and it may play a role in liver inflammation that has yet to be appreciated. Serum AST was linked to the PZP gene. PZP is structurally closely related to alpha-2-macroglobulin, which is a non-invasive biomarker for predicting hepatic fibrosis. PZP binds to TGF-beta 1 and 2 in a manner that is similar to binding of the TGF-beta and alpha 2-macroglobulin. PZP binds to TGF-beta 1 preferentially over TGF-beta-2 and regulates it's plasma clearance. TGF-beta signaling is strongly linked to hepatic fibrogenesis and carcinogenesis and is involved in the pathogenesis of NASH fibrosis. These multiple associations require further studies to confirm the linkage and to elucidate the biological basis for the associations.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 24473, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "title_2"}, "text": "Strengths and limitations of the study", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 24512, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The strengths of this study include that patients were derived from diverse geographic areas within United States, well-characterized liver histology, prospectively collected and measured laboratory and recorded demographic variables, and biological plausibility of findings.

Additionally, the study was able to exclude individuals who may have alcoholic liver disease because of stringent entry criteria.

Since the seminal observation by Romeo et al., that showed a very strong relationship between rs738409 C G polymorphism of PNPLA3 and hepatic steatosis, several studies have examined the relationship between genetic variability in PNPLA3 and liver histology in patients with NAFLD. In a study that combined 321 NAFLD patients from UK and 253 NAFLD patients from Italy, Valenti et al., have shown that PNPLA3 genotype was associated with severity of steatosis, presence of steatohepatitis, and severity of fibrosis. However, these associations could not be reproduced entirely in the subset of NAFLD patients from Italy, presumably due to small sample size. More recently, Rotman et al., reported the association between genetic variability in PNPLA3 and liver histology in 1197 individuals with NAFLD (96% from the NASH CRN studies, 19% children). This study showed a statistically significant relationship between PNPLA3 genotype and degree of steatosis, inflammation, NAS, and fibrosis (but not steatohepatitis). Interestingly, in a subgroup analysis, investigators did not find any significant relationship between PNPLA3 genotype and liver histology in pediatric patients with NAFLD. In another study that consisted of 678 NAFLD patients (also from the NASH CRN), PNPLA3 genotype was significantly associated with the degree of inflammation and fibrosis, but not with steatosis severity, ballooning or the presence of steatohepatitis. It is unclear why we did not find any relationship between PNPLA3 genetic variability and liver histology in this study, but this may be a reflection of our modest sample size and highly select group of patients (i.e., adult Caucasian women).", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 27170, "infons": {"section_type": "CONCL", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "Conclusions", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 27182, "infons": {"section_type": "CONCL", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "In this GWAS, novel associations were found between genes involved in lipid metabolism, growth factors and collagen deposition and with histologic and biochemical features of NAFLD in a well-characterized cohort of non-Hispanic, Caucasian women participants of the NASH CRN.

The specific histologic phenotype may be regulated by genes involved in diverse metabolic pathways. This pilot study provides preliminary data that GWAS approach may lead to identification of novel genes involved in the pathogenesis of NAFLD and NASH.
