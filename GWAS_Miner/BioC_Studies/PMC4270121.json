The LASSO regression selected 80 independent SNPs as the best predictor of the FEV1/FVC ratio. Consistent with an additive genetic model, the mean phenotypic value decreases with increasing number of \"risk\" alleles (Fig. 2). Moreover, this approach led to the discovery of additional genes, including three independent clusters of beta-defensin genes, two chemokine genes, and a tumor necrosis factor (TNF) family receptor, suggesting an important link between host defense mechanisms and lung function. Defensins are antimicrobial peptides that recruit inflammatory cells and modulate innate and adaptive immune responses, participating in both the promotion and resolution of inflammatory responses. There are three classes of defensins, but only the beta-defensins are specifically expressed in epithelial cells, including those lining the respiratory tract. Genetic studies have implicated the beta-defensin genes on chromosome 8p23 in lung function in patients with asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and with cystic fibrosis (CF). In particular, DEFB1 mRNA in bronchial epithelial cell biopsies was significantly elevated in COPD patients compared to controls and significantly associated with both reduced FEV1 and the FEV1/FVC ratio in COPD patients and controls. The results of our studies would further suggest that all three clusters of beta-defensin genes on chromosomes 8p23, 20p13, and 20q11 contribute to lung function in healthy, unselected subjects. Chemokines are small proteins that bind to G-protein-coupled receptors and orchestrate the migration of circulating leukocytes to sites of inflammation. CCL18 (also named PARC, pulmonary and activated-regulated cytokine) is constitutively and highly expressed in the human lung, and can generate regulatory T cells from CD4+CD25- T cells in healthy individuals via direct induction of transforming growth factor beta1 (TGF-beta1). Functional polymorphisms in the promoter of the TGFB1 gene have been associated with airway responsiveness and asthma exacerbations, and haplotypes comprised of polymorphisms and specific coding variants in this gene have been associated with lung function in CF patients, although the exact variants and direction of effect are inconsistent across studies. Moreover, both beta-defensin-2 and CCL18 were significantly elevated in peripheral blood from COPD patients compared to smoking and non-smoking controls, CXCL12 (also name SDF-1, stromal derived growth factor 1) is critical to bone marrow-derived stem cell production, and shows increased expression in bronchial alveolar lavage fluid after bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis in a murine model, and in airway tissues in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis compared to controls. The TNFRSF13B gene encodes the transmembrane activator and calcium modulator and cyclophilin ligand interactor (TACI), which binds two ligands, BAFF (B-cell activating factor) and APRIL (a proliferating-inducing ligand). It is thought that TACI plays a key role in B cell activation and differentiation into plasma cells. In a recent study, rare mutations in TNFRSF13B were associated with asthma symptoms in Swedish children. Moreover, BAFF expression in alveolar macrophages was inversely correlated with lung function in COPD patients. Our study extends the roles of these two chemokines and TNF-family receptor to inter-individual variability in normal lung function.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 22563, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Despite conducting this study in a relatively small sample (~1,000 Hutterites) and the absence of a major locus influencing variation in lung function compared to other traits (for examples, see references), we were successful in identifying both genome-wide significant associations with replicated loci on chromosome 15 in the combined sample and on chromosome 10 in the non-asthmatic subset, in addition to a set of novel variants that are highly predictive for lung function in the Hutterites. The power of our study was likely enhanced by the homogeneity of the Hutterite population compared to the larger population samples that have been included in previous studies of lung function. The advantages of this population for genetic studies of complex phenotypes are primarily two-fold. On the one hand, it is possible that there are fewer lung function-associated alleles segregating in the Hutterites due to the population bottleneck that occurred prior to their emigration to the United States. This would result in a simpler genetic architecture due to both overall reduced genetic variation and increased frequencies of some variants with potentially larger phenotypic effects that are rare in other European populations. On the other hand, their communal lifestyle and shared environmental exposures, which include the absence of exposure to cigarette smoke and air pollution, may have enhanced the effects of genetic variation in general, and on specific pathways in particular, on lung development and subsequent lung function. In this population, exposures are remarkably similar during critical periods of lung development both in utero and in early life. Hutterite women and young children are not directly involved in farming activities, and their homes are generally distant from the agricultural fields and animal barns. Meals are prepared in a communal kitchen, using traditional recipes that are shared among the colonies. There are no pets, televisions, radios, or computers in the homes, and, as a result, Hutterite children spend significant proportions of each day playing outside. Thus, the absence of important environmental exposures that impact lung development and lung function, combined with a shared environment throughout life, not only reduces non-genetic heterogeneity but also allows for the detection of lung function alleles that are not confounded with those related to socioeconomic factors or behavior, such as cigarette smoking, or to ecogenetic pathways that are important in metabolizing inhaled particles. These population characteristics possibly enabled the novel finding in this study of an enrichment of genes involved in anti-microbial immunity in the airways among those associated with lung function.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 25317, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "In summary, this study identifies genome-wide significant associations between lung function and SNPs at the THSD4-UACA-TLE3 locus on chromosome 15q23 and the C10orf11 on chromosome 10, and replicates many other previous GWAS results.
