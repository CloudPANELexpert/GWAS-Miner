Seven of these loci reached P < 10-4, among which five have previously been evaluated in large collaborative analyses of case-control studies by the Breast Cancer Association Consortium (BCAC). The BCAC analyses involved more than 20,000 cases and 20,000 controls, providing a reliable estimate of the per-allele OR. For each of these five SNPs, the per-allele OR in the current study was higher than that estimated from the population-based studies by BCAC by a factor of 1.46-fold to 1.75-fold (P < 0.05 for difference in OR for all SNPs except rs13281615; Supplementary Table 1). This enrichment is broadly consistent with the selection of cases with a family history, assuming a multiplicative polygenic model (which predicts a 1.5-fold higher excess relative risk for the associated SNP for women with one affected first-degree relative and a twofold higher excess relative risk for women with two affected first-degree relatives). The loci on 5p12 (rs7716600, a surrogate for rs10941679) and 1p11.2 do not conform to this pattern, having smaller ORs than those published previously (a 1.5-fold higher excess OR can be excluded here in each case, P = 0.018 and P = 0.015, respectively). These results suggest either that the initial effect sizes were overestimated (perhaps due to 'winner's curse') or that these loci have weaker than expected effects in women with a family history due to a different model of susceptibility than is applicable for the other loci. We also found limited evidence in support of the association with the CASP8 D302H polymorphism (P = 0.14; Table 1).

The per-allele OR was higher in stage 1 than stage 2 for each SNP (P < 0.05 in each case; Supplementary Table 2).

For rs2380205 and rs704010, the per-allele ORs for estrogen receptor-positive and estrogen receptor-negative disease were similar, but the number of estrogen receptor-negative cases used was too small to draw firm conclusions on the effect sizes for this subset (Supplementary Table 4).", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 9428, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "To examine whether there was evidence for a more strongly associated variant in any of the above regions, we used imputation to estimate the genotype probabilities in the stage 1 data at known SNPs in region using the HapMap CEU data as a framework.

The combined effect of all loci was then derived by summing the locus-specific contributions (that is, assuming a log-additive model). Imputed genotypes for non-typed SNPs were estimated using Mach (see URLs), using the HapMap CEU data as a framework. Haplotype analyses were conducted in haplo.stats. Haplotypes were based on SNPs in each region that were significantly associated with breast cancer at P < 0.001, after eliminating perfectly correlated SNPs. Per-haplotype ORs were estimated using the haplo.cc routine. Other analyses were performed in R, principally using GenABEL, and Stata (R, http://www.r-project.org/; Stata, http://www.stata.com/).", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 23863, "infons": {"section_type": "METHODS", "type": "footnote"}, "text": "Note: Supplementary information is available on the Nature Genetics website.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 23940, "infons": {"section_type": "METHODS", "type": "footnote"}, "text": "AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS: D.F.E., N.R., M.R.S., P.D.P.P. and A.M.D. obtained funding for the study.
