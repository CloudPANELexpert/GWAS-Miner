As a consequence, key drugs may be unnecessarily stopped, thereby creating a health risk to the patient. DILI is also the single, major adverse event that leads to termination of clinical drug development programs and to regulatory actions on approved drugs.

The reduced effect size observed in the validation cohort suggests the possibility of a 'winner's curse' effect, but is also consistent with a chance association: given the seven SNPs carried forward for validation testing, it is not unlikely that one of them would continue to show an association in the validation cohort simply due to chance. We therefore cannot conclude that this is a true association, but we believe further study of the possible relationship between STAT4 variation and hepatocellular DILI is warranted.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 23740, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Although our sample sizes for each implicated drug were generally small, we found some interesting trends toward associations with specific drugs. For example, an SNP upstream of the PPARG gene was associated with diclofenac DILI at almost the genome-wide significance level and with an OR of 30 (Table 4). Diclofenac has been shown previously to interact with the PPARgamma receptor at pharmacologic concentrations of the drug, and PPARgamma activation has been shown to influence inflammation, specifically by diclofenac. Although this strong association was not replicated in our second cohort, the trend was in the same direction, the replication cohort was small, and the association in the combined cohorts remained almost genome-wide significant. Given the biological plausibility of this association, additional studies are warranted. For statin cases, an association with a STAT4 SNP reached specified significance for the autoimmune-restricted analysis but also did not replicate in our second smaller cohort. Given the large population receiving statin medications and the current controversy about the DILI risk that statins pose, this observation also requires additional studies.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 24934, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "It seems unlikely that the lack of replication of tentative associations indicates differences in the characteristics of the discovery and replication samples. The larger proportion of amoxicillin/clavulanate and flucloxacillin-DILI cases in the discovery cohort did not appear to account for the failure to replicate, and other characteristics such as severity of injury, causality assessment, or patient characteristics appeared to be comparable between cohorts. Genotype calls between the GWAS chip and the targeted TaqMan assays were also perfectly concordant for all samples examined. The most likely reason for failure to replicate associations of interest (Table 4) therefore may be that these were simply false associations. This is consistent with the fact none of the variants carried forward to replication achieved genome-wide significance in the discovery cohort, and most of the variants selected on the basis of the ADME-restricted or autoimmune-restricted analysis were only approaching or barely surpassing a more lenient threshold for significance.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 26001, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Recently reported GWAS have identified common alleles in the MHC region as risk factors for DILI. If an adaptive immune attack on the liver is the final common event that causes significant liver injury, it is possible that only patients carrying certain MHC alleles are at risk of DILI from a specific drug, that is, 'upstream' events (e.g. hepatocyte accumulation of critical reactive metabolites or bile acids) may be necessary but not sufficient to produce DILI. We therefore carried out an exploratory analysis of the association signal in the MHC region compared with autosomal regions outside of the MHC after excluding DILI cases due to flucloxacillin or amoxicillin/clavulanate. Although the P-value distribution was lower in the MHC region compared with elsewhere (Supplementary Fig. S4, http://links.lww.com/FPC/A505), after permutation testing, the enrichment of the association signal in the MHC region only approached significance (empirical P = 0.015). The observed trend toward enrichment could be due to the extremely high degree of linkage disequilibrium among SNPs in the MHC region and/or an artifact of uncorrected population structure, as low-frequency subpopulation-specific variants in the MHC may not be accounted for by principal components analysis based largely on common variants outside of the MHC. Our analysis therefore does not support the concept of common MHC variation as a general risk factor for DILI, but does not exclude drug-specific or drug subset-specific effects.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 27513, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "On the basis of the power calculations carried out (Fig. 2), we estimate that common variants conferring the risk of a moderate effect size (i.e. RR >= 1.5) to all-cause DILI should have been discovered in our study. It is of note that in our initial GWAS analysis of all DILI cases, the MHC signals driven solely by the flucloxacillin and amoxicillin/clavulanate cases were appreciable at the genome-wide significance level (Fig. 1), although these cases account for only 38% of the cohort. As a further example of the ability to detect strong associations despite gross misclassification of phenotype, an analysis that included DILI cases due to flucloxacillin and all other drugs except amoxicillin/clavulanate identified the rs2395209 association (due to flucloxacillin) at the genome-wide significance level, despite the fact that flucloxacillin made up only 13.4% of the total cases (Fig. 3). Individuals carrying the HLA-B*5701 allele have about an 80-fold increased risk of developing DILI when treated with flucloxacillin. Hence, if any combination of individuals comprising a similarly small fraction of our cohort had a common risk factor with comparable effect, we would have detected it in our GWAS analysis. The fact that no other risk variants were detected in the genome-wide analyses is therefore an important negative finding for identifying common SNPs with a very strong effect on DILI risk.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 28926, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Our negative GWAS findings may suggest that future efforts should focus on collecting and analyzing DILI cases due to single drugs.

With amoxicillin/clavulanate-DILI, more than 50 cases would be required to demonstrate an HLA association by GWAS (OR~3). Test and replication cohorts of this size may simply not be feasible for most drugs implicated in the existing registries. If there in fact exist common genetic variants that underlie susceptibility to DILI, it may still be feasible to identify them with GWAS if a sufficient number of DILI cases due to diverse drugs could be 'clustered' by a common mechanism or surrogates for mechanism.

As DILI is such a rare event (occurring on average in fewer than one in 10 000 patients), the expected rate of misclassification of control individuals using unselected population controls is very low and should not appreciably impact statistical power to detect a genetic association (, Supplementary Table S39, http://links.lww.com/FPC/A505). However, this study design does not allow us to directly test for the effects of environmental risk factors for DILI, such as age, sex, or diagnosis/indication for the precipitant drug(s), among other factors.

Analytical approaches that could detect the synergistic effects of multiple SNPs are fraught with statistical (multiple comparison) and computational hurdles and such investigations would probably need to be directed by solid data on biological plausibility. It should also be acknowledged that effects not captured by GWAS or genome sequencing are likely to also contribute to DILI risk, including epigenetic or environmental effects as described above. Nonetheless, the availability of the DILI gene banks and the rapidly evolving genomic technology available currently make genetic investigation of DILI a high-priority area of research.
