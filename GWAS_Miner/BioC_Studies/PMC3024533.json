If the two diseases were similar in terms of their epidemiology then the subjects suffering from either disease might be similar in terms of genetic and non-genetic background. Typically, unaffected controls will have been recruited from a non-clinical setting and might differ in subtle ways from a patient sample. By contrast, samples of patients suffering from different diseases might be similar to each other in a number of respects. If they are recruited from the same clinical setting they might be similar in terms of their geographical background, their social class and factors influencing presentation to services. If the two diseases share risk factors, which might be genetic or non-genetic, the two patient samples might be well matched for such risk factors and this would be expected to confer an advantage when seeking to identify genetic risk factors specific to one or other disease. Having well matched samples reduces background noise and is expected to increase both the power and specificity of association studies.

Thus, one might postulate that there were a number of factors which combined to produce a high probability that a subject would develop some form of psychotic illness but that there might also be a common variant which would influence whether this illness took the form of schizophrenia or bipolar disorder.
