Direct genotyping of the top imputed SNPs confirmed that imputation was generally accurate (average concordance between imputed and directly genotyped genotypes was 98.3%). In order to protect against spurious associations due to possible cryptic relatedness, the SNPs chosen for replication were also analyzed using the mixed model approach (rs140817150; p combined = 1.5 x 10-10, OR = 2.66; Table S7) and by stratifying individuals on the basis of genetic background across the main ethnic groups (rs140817150; p discovery = 1.5 x 10-7, OR = 2.54; Figure S11). By either approach, the evidence for association remained strong. The pneumococcal case subjects do not have more close relatives than the control subjects in any of the four ancestry groups (p >= 0.22). When compared to other case subjects, they show elevated levels of relatedness (p < 0.05) in group 1 only, which does not contribute strongly to the observed association signal (Figure S11).
