Reliable genetic prognostic markers are still not well established. We present the first genome-wide survival and validation study for glioblastoma patients treated with the current standard of care, resection, radiation and temozolomide. Using Cox regressions for genome-wide survival analysis, followed by functional validation in tumor expression and genotype imputation, we identified a variant in SSBP2  (single-stranded DNA-binding protein 2) and the tumor expression of SSBP2 to be significantly associated with patient survival. Identification and characterization of the role of genetic variation in predicting glioblastoma patient survival may help optimize clinical trial study design and individualize patient treatment plans.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}], "annotations": [], "relations": []}]}
