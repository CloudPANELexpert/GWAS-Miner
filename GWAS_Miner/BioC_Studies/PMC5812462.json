A meta-analysis of twin studies on major depressive disorder (MDD) estimated the heritability between 31 and 42%. The success of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) aiming to find genes underlying vulnerability for depression, however, has been limited; the most promising findings to date are poorly replicated and explain only a small proportion of this heritability. This may be explained by the polygenic architecture of the trait as well as difficulties in diagnosis. A validated biomarker for depression does not exist and the diagnosis is based solely on symptoms. Such symptoms include depressed mood states, loss of interest in activities, feelings of worthlessness or inappropriate guilt, recurrent thoughts of death, poor concentration, and somatic symptoms such as changes in appetite, sleep patterns, fatigue, and weight gain or loss. Depression can manifest with different patterns of symptoms, and such phenotypic heterogeneity may reflect genetic heterogeneity. It is plausible that different genetic pathways are associated with the various symptom clusters, and analyses of more narrowly defined phenotypes may reduce genetic heterogeneity. Indeed, the diverse domains of complaints, which result in variations in presentation of the disease within and between populations, may lead to problems for gene discovery. A focus on outcomes based on depressive symptoms and endophenotypes has been shown to increase power in association studies.

There was no restriction on age. Each study center computed the subscales of the CES-D questionnaire that resulted in four separate scores for each individual, measuring different domains of complaints.

On the other hand, this does not count for the replication set. Among them, for instance the RUSH sample included more women and older persons and reported very low mean values for the somatic items (Table 1).

An additional sensitivity analysis, excluding the RUSH study, yielded a pdiscovery+replication = 4.96 x 10-7 and decreased the heterogeneity (phet = 0.08), but did not exclude it completely. A particular reason of heterogeneity for the melatonin receptor signaling-related outcomes is the interaction with melatonin levels as reviewed extensively before and therefore the influence on depressive symptoms may be season specific, depending on the calendar time and latitude that the depression screening took place.

In addition, responses to specific symptom clusters may be population specific due to cultural acceptance or practices. Moreover, age differences across the CHARGE cohorts might have played a role as presentation of depressive symptoms strongly differs by age whereas some genetic variants are hypothesized to interact with age. These would probably introduce phenotypic and genetic heterogeneity. To see if the individual studies were indeed genetically controlled we estimated the SNP-based heritability from the separate GWAS summary statistics collected in this research. The SNP-based heritability estimations in the meta-analysis were surprisingly low (1-4%), indicating the reason for the sparse findings. This is partially due to several reasons sourcing from the genetic architecture of the traits, which are not adequately addressed by the simple association models; such as exclusion of X chromosome, and limiting the analysis only with an additive genetic model which deviates from sufficient power when the MAF < 0.5. Another important reason is that interaction of any genetic determinant with stressful life events, traumas, therapeutic agents, smoking or menopause, which may confer risk to depression, were neglected. We further estimated the co-heritability to see if there are genetic outliers amongst the meta-analysis cohorts. This revealed surprisingly low co-heritability across the contributing cohorts, explaining the lack of successful meta-analysis and replication in our study. The low co-heritability estimations are the indicators of high genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity across the cohorts and are the plausible explanation of insignificant replication in our research.
