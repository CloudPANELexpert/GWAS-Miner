Second, the association was consistent across multiple samples of type 2 diabetic participants of different ethnic and geographical origin, reaching nominal significance in four of the five sets that were considered. Third, the difference in odds ratios between diabetic and non-diabetic participants was supported by a robust P value for interaction. Finally, an association between this locus and CHD was also found in a large study of the general population (CARDIoGRAM) with a magnitude similar to what one would expect based on the effects detected in our study in diabetic and non-diabetic participants and the prevalence of diabetes in CARDIoGRAM.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 21652, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "GLUL - the gene whose expression is decreased in risk allele carriers - encodes glutamate-ammonia ligase (also known as glutamine synthase), which catalyzes the conversion of glutamic acid and ammonia into glutamine. Both amino acids play important roles in human physiology. Glutamic acid is a key intermediate of several metabolic pathways, most notably of the gamma-glutamyl cycle through which the anti-oxidant glutathione is generated; glutamine is involved in the regulation of cell proliferation, inhibition of apoptosis, and cell signaling. Evidence from experimental and human studies points to glutamine/glutamic acid metabolism as contributing to the regulation of insulin secretion and glucose metabolism. In islets, glutamine enhances both mitochondrial metabolism and insulin secretion. In diabetic patients, it was found that glutamine reduced glucose excursions when given before oral glucose and effectively increased circulating incretin and insulin concentrations. Several clinical trials also suggest cardioprotective effects of glutamine used parenterally and enterally.; In epidemiological studies, abnormal metabolism of these amino acids has been shown to be related to insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular disorders.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 22914, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The mechanisms through which alterations of glutamate and glutamine metabolism, such as those that one would expect from the reduced GLUL expression observed in risk allele carriers, may lead to increased CHD risk are unclear at this time. The newly identified CHD risk variant was not associated with risk of type 2 diabetes in DIAGRAM, suggesting that the pathways underlying the association with CHD are distinct from those involved in the etiology of type 2 diabetes. Similarly, the absence of association between the risk variant and serum fasting insulin, HOMA-IR, or 2 hr-glucose in the MAGIC database seems to exclude insulin-resistance as the underlying mechanism. Rather, our finding of association between the risk variant and a lower pyroglutamic-to-glutamic acid ratio in plasma, and the fact that the association between risk allele and CHD was attenuated after adjustment for this variable, suggest an impairment of the gamma-glutamyl cycle, of which pyroglutamic acid is an intermediate, as a possible mechanism. Such alteration might increase CHD risk by limiting the availability of the natural antioxidant glutathione, compounding the known negative effect of diabetes on this metabolite and potentially explaining the fact that this genetic effect can only be observed among diabetic participants. Consistent with this hypothesis, an association between rs10911021 and pyroglutamine (expressed as the ratio with the fatty acid sebacate) is also found in the KORA/Twins UK metabolomic databases (p=0.00096 in KORA, http://metabolomics.helmholtzmuenchen.de/gwa). However, additional contributions by pathways that are not directly related to glutamate and glutamine may also be present as other metabolites implicated in vascular biology and atherogenesis, such as the long chain omega3-polyunsaturated fatty acid eicosapentaenoate (EPA; 20:5n3) and a variety of lysophospholipids,; are associated with rs10911021 in those same databases. Further studies are clearly needed to dissect the mechanisms linking this locus to the development and progression of atherosclerosis in diabetes. As part of these efforts, it would be useful to extend the study to type 1 diabetes as this may provide clues on whether the gene-x-diabetes interaction involves hyperglycemia or instead concerns factors that are specific to type 2 diabetes such as insulin-resistance or some of the genes predisposing to this form of diabetes, even though the lack of interaction in our study between rs10911021 and genetic variants predisposing to type 2 diabetes makes the latter hypothesis unlikely.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 25505, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Our study has several strengths, namely the replication design with five independent cohorts of diabetic patients, a rigorous definition of CHD, and a sample size that was adequate for the detection of additive genetic effects of the magnitude reported. Nonetheless, some limitations should be acknowledged. First, while our study was powered to detect major genetic effects such as that described in this report, larger studies would be necessary to detect loci having smaller but still relevant effects on CHD risk in diabetes. In this context, the use of analytical methods based on biological pathways such as Gene Ontology (GO) might lead to the identification of additional genetic determinants of CHD in diabetic patients and provide further insights on the links between diabetes and atherogenesis. Second, our study was restricted to non-Hispanic Whites and whether these findings can be generalized to other races remain to be determined. Also, based on the known differences in linkage disequilibrium patterns among races, different genetic markers may be more effective in capturing the predisposing effect of the locus described in this paper in other racial groups. Finally, one should consider that the achieved level of statistical significance, while it meets genome-wide significance, still corresponds to a 5% probability of a false-positive result.
