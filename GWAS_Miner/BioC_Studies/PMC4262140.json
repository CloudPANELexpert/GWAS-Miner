Changes in the amplitude of activity within specific bands are robustly found to be associated with variations in overall arousal level as well as with different cognitive or perceptual processes. EEG characteristics of neuropsychiatric disorders are subtle, typically consisting primarily of quantitative changes in the amplitude of activity occurring at particular frequencies or over specific scalp locations corresponding to differing areas of cortex.

EEG activity is intimately related to the organism's level of arousal and attention, both of which are directly modulated by cholinergic pathways in the ascending reticular formation. For instance, decreased discharge levels of cholinergic projections to basal forebrain neurons results in large EEG slow waves, such as those observed during sleep. Noradrenergic modulation complements cholinergic activity during waking states. In general, the specific form of EEG activity, particularly the magnitude of activity and the frequency of EEG oscillations, reflects the balance between excitatory and inhibitory neuronal interactions, both within and between populations of neurons. Different frequencies of oscillations in turn are consistently associated with particular cognitive and perceptual states. The alpha rhythm, for example, originates in multiple thalamocortical projections, and it is typically observed during periods when an individual is relaxed but alert. It is most prominent when measured over the visual cortex in an individual with eyes closed; it thus appears to reflect an intrinsic rhythm that is greatest in amplitude in the absence of sensory load and in a state of inactivity. It has been proposed that alpha activity (increased synchronization) serves a control function, inhibiting activity in particular neural circuits, which facilitates in turn the appropriate timing of cortical processes as well as protecting against intrusion by irrelevant information into selective attention and short-term memory.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 10947, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Some individuals exhibit very low levels of alpha activity.

More recent research with humans has corroborated the role of 'sensorimotor' beta activity in motor inhibition by demonstrating that initiating movement is robustly accompanied by decreases in beta power.

In rodents, coherent theta oscillations between hippocampus and PFC are critical for spatial working memory and encoding relevant information for long-term storage.

Subsequent analysis of individual SNPs to determine the source of this signal obtained significant associations between beta activity and SNPs in the gene that encodes the GABA alpha2 receptor subunit (GABRA2). A recent case-control study of alcohol dependence obtained significant associations between beta activity and several GABRA2 SNPs.

In typical biometric models three latent variables account for the variance in each phenotype: additive genes (A), common or shared environment (C), and unique or unshared environment (E). The correlations among family members with respect to the three latent variables determine the within-family phenotypic correlations. For instance, the family environment is shared equally by all family members, so the correlation for C is 1, whereas DZ twins and parents and offspring share half their genes, so the genetic correlation is 0.5 in these pairs but 1 in MZ twins. E is by definition unique to each individual. Models were fit to data from four-member families as well as based only on twins, the latter to facilitate comparisons between the present results and published data, which is predominantly based on twin data. Additional detail concerning our model-fitting approach is provided in Iacono et al.. As noted in that paper, we also evaluated possible dominance (D) effects, and fit and report the results of ADE model fitting in the twin sample where appropriate. Because variances tended to differ between males and females as well as between adolescents and adults (see Table 2 in Iacono et al., 2014, this issue), dummy variables representing these two characteristics were included as (scalar) moderators of phenotype variance in our biometric models.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 30330, "infons": {"section_type": "METHODS", "type": "title_3"}, "text": "SNP heritability", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 30347, "infons": {"section_type": "METHODS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "In addition, we estimated the proportion of variance in each EEG parameter accounted for by the combined additive effect of all Illumina markers (and those in linkage disequilibrium, or LD, with them) using GCTA.

Genotypic similarity is represented in the form of a genetic relatedness matrix (GRM), which resembles a correlation matrix representing pairwise genetic similarity. In samples consisting of closely related individuals, Yang and colleagues have recommended filtering the sample by means of several thresholds of genetic relatedness in order to look for consistency across the resulting estimates.

The same covariates were used as in all other analyses (age, gender, generation, recording system, and the 10 PCs from EIGENSTRAT). Because LD can bias SNP heritability estimates upward, we repeated the three analyses after weighting SNPs by local LD patterns. It has been recommended more recently when the sample consists of closely related individuals to estimate the total genetic variance while modeling the environmental influences family members share (the C latent variable in biometric models).

This allele tags a haplotype that confers risk for heavy drinking and an early onset of alcohol dependence. Our finding is thus consistent with evidence that beta power is reduced in alcohol dependence and related disinhibitory psychopathology. As others have indicated, GABRA2 is a plausible candidate for association with beta power in particular. GABRA2 encodes the alpha2 subunit of the GABAA receptor, and inhibitory GABAergic interneurons are centrally involved in producing high frequency oscillations, particularly those in the beta and gamma range. The specific frequency of oscillations in neuronal networks is dependent on the magnitude and kinetics of inhibitory synaptic potentials between interneurons mediated specifically by GABAA receptors. Of course, this is not the only source of beta activity; coherent oscillations of excitatory neurons represent another important mechanism. Nevertheless, GABAergic activity is clearly particularly important for \"inhibition-based\" high-frequency rhythms. In addition, a number of studies have reported associations between the GABRA2 gene and externalizing spectrum disorders, such as heavy drinking or alcohol or drug dependence, perhaps with anxiety, and antisocial personality, or related personality traits.

Heritability estimates were substantial, and SNP heritability estimates indicated that as much as half the heritable variance in EEG endophenotypes is likely accounted for by the common variants on our genotyping array. However, we identified few specific variants, whether SNPs or genes.
