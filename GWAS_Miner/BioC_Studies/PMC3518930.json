This may account for the lower LDL-C levels seen during therapy irrespective of host genotype or on-treatment responses. In contrast, LDL-C levels differ in HCV-infected vs cured patients, suggesting a direct role for the virus. Furthermore, in HCV-infected patients (whether pretreatment or non-SVR post-treatment) the effect of the virus on LDL-C level differs significantly by host IL28B genotype. The underlying mechanism of how IL28B genetic variation is associated with treatment-induced and spontaneous HCV clearance remains unclear, although it is presumed to be immune related. The viral dependency of the association between host genetics and LDL-C and the inverse correlation between HCV RNA levels and LDL-C (Figures S1 & S2), suggests LDL-C is a marker of HCV interference in lipid metabolism, mediated by host genetics.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 22418, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Increased expression of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) provides a possible functional explanation and weak correlation has previously been found between ISG expression and LDL-C levels. Higher levels of ISG expression pretreatment have been associated with nonresponse to treatment and have also been correlated with poor response IL28B genotype, although a recent study has suggested these factors may work independently. Unfortunately, ISG expression data were not available in this clinical trial cohort. The functional mechanisms underlying these genetic associations remain undetermined.

In multivariable modelling of SVR, LDL-C level was significant for heterozygous IL28B patients and may potentially allow better prognostication of treatment response.
