The non-additive discovery screen enabled us to identify 4 known loci which would have otherwise been missed, indicating that this technique may be an important screening tool. Although the 1000 Genomes based imputation interrogated twice as many SNPs as other recent analyses, including that of the CARDIoGRAM consortium, only three of the loci brought to replication were based on haplotypes not present in previous imputation reference sets. Thus, the utility of this approach will likely be contingent on the progressive availability of a larger number of reference haplotypes, so as to better enable imputation of lower frequency variants.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 21850, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Of note, these two approaches do not appear to have contributed substantially to the novel association in the MHC locus, since rs3869109 was genotyped directly in most of the studies included in this analysis and was identified by an additive inheritance model. The fact that the MHC was identified here but not in previous studies likely reflects several factors. One can subdivide previous GWAS efforts into those which featured large scale discovery meta-analyses, most notably the recent CARDIoGRAM and C4D reports, and previous investigations. Studies published before CARDIoGRAM and C4D either featured smaller discovery populations than analyzed here, with a consequent reduction in power, or staged designs, which, although successful, can certainly miss SNPs. Consider for example the highly successful meta-analysis by the Myocardial Infarction Genomics Consortium (MIGC), which, despite identifying 5 new loci for CAD/MI, failed to identify several loci with rather large effect sizes, such as PPAP2B and ADAMTS7. In the C4D meta-analysis, it is worth noting that their European discovery population was smaller than analyzed here (8,424 versus 13,949), and while their combined South-East Asian and European discovery population was significantly larger than analyzed here, C4D was by intent a non-ethnically homogeneous population. If the association is driven by haplotypes of varying frequency among different populations, it is not surprising that it was not evident in a GWAS meta analysis including multi-ethnic populations.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 23393, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "It is also important to note that the design of studies which made up the discovery meta-analysis in this study generally featured early-onset CAD cases with a family history of CAD whereas controls were recruited on the basis of normal angiograms and/or age greater than 70 years with no history or symptoms of vascular disease. This was a consequence of the decision to base the primary (discovery) analysis of this study on subjects for whom genotype level data was available in Ottawa. This was primarily intended to facilitate imputation and analysis in a timely and uniform fashion but also secondarily led to the aforementioned more rigorously defined CAD case/control phenotype. Consequently, replication samples were sought with similar phenotypic definitions at a sample size which would ensure replication of genuinely associated putative loci. Thus, in comparison to CARDIoGRAM, for which there exists substantial overlap in subjects considered here, a more uniform study description was used, which would be expected to decrease effect heterogeneity among studied studies. Most notably, CARDIoGRAM included approximately 60,000 out of 85,000, or two thirds of its subjects from population studies with incident disease and population (unscreened controls). Although CARDIoGRAM was highly successful, the efforts taken here in selecting more similar studies (both ethnically with North-Western Europeans and phenotypically with extreme case control designs) could be expected to decrease effect heterogeneity between studies and facilitate identification of new loci. Finally, it is worth noting that even in CARDIoGRAM, loci identified elsewhere, including LIPA locus and PDGFD did not reach significance.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 25112, "infons": {"section_type": "CONCL", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "Conclusion", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 25123, "infons": {"section_type": "CONCL", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "We have identified a novel association with CAD at 6p21.3 within the MHC locus.
