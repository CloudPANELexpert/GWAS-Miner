WML burden was shown to be highly heritable. Age and hypertension are the main known risk factors for WML but explain only a small proportion of lesion presence and burden. Prior to the era of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) candidate gene studies investigated variants in 19 genes and found associations between WML extent and polymorphisms in the apolipoprotein E, the methylentetrahydrofolate reductase, the angiotensin-converting enzyme and the angiotensinogen genes. Moreover, genetic variants in the NOTCH3 gene may not only play a role in CADASIL, a monogenic cerebral small vessel disease, but are also likely to be involved in the etiology of age-related WML burden. In 2011, the Cohorts for Heart and Aging Research in Genomic Epidemiology (CHARGE) Consortium performed the first genome-wide association study on WML burden in the general population. The CHARGE investigators identified 6 SNPs mapping to a locus on chromosome 17q25 to be related to WML burden. The findings of the discovery meta-analyses had been confirmed in an independent sample of 1607 AGES-Reykjavik participants and in 1417 and 1677 elderly white participants from the Three-City-Dijon Study and the Rotterdam Study III as well as in a study of WML burden in persons with a clinical ischemic stroke. The association was also confirmed in an Asian population including 1190 Japanese persons with a mean age of 66 years. The region on chromosome 17 is approximately 100 kb long and harbors several genes with diverse functions such as the 2 tripartite motif-containing genes (TRIM65 and TRIM47) the WW domain binding protein 2 gene (WBP2), the mitochondrial ribosomal protein L38 gene (MRPL38), the Fas-binding factor 1 gene (FBF1), the acyl-coenzyme A oxidase 1 gene (ACOX1) and the C-Elegans homolog (UNC13D) gene. Although genetic factors may play an important role in the occurrence of WML in middle-aged to older adults, whether these genes or others influence the further progression of WML is unknown. Using data on WML progression from all the cohorts currently available within the CHARGE consortium, we examined the heritability of WML progression and performed a meta-analysis of GWAS data in 7773 individuals of European descent from 10 cohorts to identify common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that influence the risk for WML progression.

This conclusion relies on three major findings. First, the family-based heritability estimate for WML progression was only 6.5% versus a heritability of 55% for baseline WML burden in the same sample. Second, our genome-wide analysis yielded no associations at a genome-wide significance level. Third, risk prediction models including highly suggestive SNPs according to the present GWAS meta-analysis plus all genetic polymorphisms that have been shown to be associated with WML burden in previous literature explained only between 0.8% and 11.7% more of the variance of WML progression than that explained by baseline clinical and MRI data. These results for WML progression oppose previous cross-sectional studies in which the contribution of genetic factors for WML burden was substantial. This finding is puzzling because cross-sectionally assessed WML burden and WML progression are both quantitative measures with presumably the same biological basis. In this context it is of note, however that in our study initial burden of WML predicted annual WML volume increase moderately, but this relationship was not significant. Moreover, for both, brain volume and cognitive functions, similar results of limited genetic variance in longitudinal measures have been shown.

Moreover, three other factors need to be considered when interpreting our results. First, we used a binary phenotype based on visual rating or cut-off values of volumetric change to define WML progression. This conservative definition decreased the likelihood of false positive ratings but, among those with WML at baseline, might have led to an underestimation of WML progression. Second, the average time period between scans among contributing cohorts was 54 months, and despite the fact that single studies had followed their participants for more than 10 years, it is conceivable that this period was too short to reveal the full impact of genetic factors on WML progression. Our findings that the effect sizes of suggestive GWAS SNPs on WML progression were not significantly larger in cohorts with long-term follow-up versus cohorts with short-term follow-up and in older versus younger cohorts do not support this assumption.

Based on current data, we need to intensify the search for potentially modifiable environmental and lifestyle factors that influence the progression of age-related white matter changes and the associated morbidity.
