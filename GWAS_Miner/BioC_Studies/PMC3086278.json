First, the similar results obtained with two highly correlated SNPs suggest that technical problems in genotyping are unlikely to explain our results. Second, the availability of methods that use dense genome-wide SNP data to estimate and account for ancestry allows us to be confident that the associations are not explained by population stratification.

Their discovery will require larger sample sizes and/or more aggressive replication efforts. This study also provides additional insights into the genetic architecture of a classic complex trait.
