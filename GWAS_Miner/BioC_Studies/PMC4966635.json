We selected SNPs that had P value significance levels at meta-analysis of <10-4. Three SNPs in loci not previously reported as associated with SLE had a genome-wide level of significance (P < 5 x 10-8) after meta-analysis. SNPs spanning a 1-Mb window were considered as one region, and we selected only independent SNPs within this region, using LD as a measure of independence. We carried out a gene-based test on the meta-analyzed data, using only SNPs with INFO scores > 0.9, with the software KGG. One SNP from each of the loci that passed a gene-based test at the level of P < 10-5 was chosen; some of these had already been selected as having P < 10-4 in the meta-analysis as single markers. In total, 105 SNPs were selected for replication in the Chinese replication cohort. Of these, 66 passed QC, and 18 SNPs with FDR < 1% were taken forward to the European replication.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 23270, "infons": {"section_type": "METHODS", "type": "title_2"}, "text": "Genotyping of replication data", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 23301, "infons": {"section_type": "METHODS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Genotyping of 130 SNPs was carried out for the 3,614 cases and 5,924 controls forming the Chinese replication set, using the Sequenom platform.

The 105 potential new SLE SNPs included, in some cases, multiple SNPs in the same loci where we had some evidence of independence. We carried out several QC steps: we removed SNPs with >10% missing data (25 SNPs), and then subjects with >5% missing data. Two SNPs were monomorphic. Of the remaining 103 SNPs, 77 were in regions of the genome with potential new SLE associations. We removed 13 SNPs after we checked the genotyping allele intensity plots closely for clustering quality and tested for Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE). SNPs were removed if HWE P < 1.00 x 10-4. After QC, the Chinese replication consisted of 3,043 cases and 5,074 controls with genotyping on 64 SNPs. The European replication data comprised 1,478 cases and 6,925 controls genotyped for 18 SNPs with an FDR of 1% in the Chinese replication study. The cases were of European ancestry and were a subset of those used in the replication study in the European GWAS; in the current study we carried out new genotyping on these 18 SNPs, and the controls were the same as used in that study (these samples were checked for European ancestry using a principal component analysis spiked with HapMap samples; see the original paper).

A Q-Q plot for each data set satisfied assumptions of normality, and given the large sample sizes, the central limit theorem would satisfy normality for the distribution of sample means.
