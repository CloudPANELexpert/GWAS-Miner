The SNPs are downstream of NABP1, which also is known as human single-strand DNA binding protein 2 or oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide binding fold-containing protein 2A. This protein binds single-stranded DNA via the oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide binding fold domain. Single-stranded DNA binding proteins are important for diverse DNA processes, such as DNA replication, recombination, transcription, and repair. Cells depleted of NABP1 show hypersensitivity to DNA-damaging reagents; NABP1 participates in repair of DNA double-strand breaks and ataxia telangiectasia mutated-dependent signaling pathways, similar to the role of its homolog, NABP2 (which is also known as human single-strand DNA binding protein 1).

The first of these 3 regions was on chromosome 1q31 and included correlated SNPs showing associations that spanned across the LAMC1 gene. Interestingly, previous genome-wide scans of colorectal cancer identified a different laminin gene on chromosome 20q13.33, laminin alpha 5, as associated with colorectal cancer, supporting the importance of this gene family for the development of colorectal cancer. Laminins are extracellular matrix glycoproteins that constitute a major component of the basement membrane in most tissues and in the colon are part of the intestinal epithelial barrier. Laminins are involved in a wide variety of biological functions, such as regulation of cell adhesion, differentiation, migration, signaling, and metastasis.

As shown in the University of California, Santa Cruz Genome Browser view (Supplementary Figure 4), rs10911205 is located within a highly evolutionarily conserved region and, given its close proximity to the promoter, it is possible that this region influences gene transcription. In addition, the patterns of histone modifications and DNase signals indicating accessibility for transcription factors suggest that this variant may affect cell-type-specific enhancer activity. In summary, given the statistical evidence, support from functional annotation, and evidence from a previous GWAS that identified another laminin gene to be associated with colorectal cancer, we believe there is strong support for the importance of LAMC1 in the development of colorectal cancer.

The Wnt/beta-catenin pathway plays a key role in colorectal cancer development.

As a result, larger sample sizes may be needed to fully replicate these SNPs. Furthermore, it is possible that the effect varies by environmental exposures, which may differ among the study populations.

However, the study also had limitations. To increase the sample size, we included Asian descent subjects, who may have different linkage disequilibrium patterns, and the SNPs analyzed may be tagging different underlying causal variants. To address this potential limitation we included all SNPs correlated with the most significant SNPs, which likely will identify any variant that genuinely is associated with colorectal cancer risk across different ancestral groups, as shown for other GWAS loci. Given that genotyping platforms only capture a subset of the genome, we used imputation to HapMap II to obtain a better coverage of the common variation across the genome and to generate a common set of SNPs from the different platforms. Because imputed SNPs tend to result in less significant findings depending on their imputation accuracy, we expect that our results provide relative conservative significance levels. Similar to previous GWAS, we included colorectal adenoma as the major precursor of colorectal cancer to improve our statistical power and to identify genetic variants that act early in the adenoma-cancer sequence, where adenomas and cancer have a shared etiology. Although the inclusion of adenoma also may add heterogeneity because adenomas will not show an association for genetic variants that act later in the carcinogenic process (ie, on progression from adenoma to cancer) or for variants that act through adenoma-independent pathways, stratified analysis may provide insights into the mediating roles of genes within the normal to adenoma to cancer pathway. We show that for some of the newly and previously identified loci, associations are stronger for adenomas compared with cancer; however, we observed similar or weaker associations for other loci. These results may suggest that some genes are important in early stages of cancer development while others may be more important for the progression from adenoma to cancer.
