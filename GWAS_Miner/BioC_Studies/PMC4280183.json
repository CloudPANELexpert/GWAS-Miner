However, for all variants, the estimated associations with asthma and hay fever were weaker than with the combined asthma with hay fever phenotype (see Table E8 in this article's Online Repository at www.jacionline.org). Three (ZBTB10, SMAD3, and CLEC16A) of the 11 associations did not reach the genome-wide significance threshold when asthma and hay fever were considered separately, even when restricting the analysis to asthma-free and hay fever-free control subjects (A+ vs A-H- and H+ vs A-H-, see Table E8).", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 19431, "infons": {"section_type": "RESULTS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "When considering the associations on the mutually exclusive phenotypes of asthma without hay fever (A+H- vs A-H-) and hay fever without asthma (A-H+vs A-H-), there were notable differences for 3 variants (Fig 1 and see Table E8). First, the LRRC32 variant was associated with an increased risk of hay fever without asthma (OR, 1.08; 95% CI, 1.04-1.12) but not asthma without hay fever (OR, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.94-1.06). The difference in risk allele frequency between A+H- cases and A-H+ cases was statistically significant (P = .014, see Table E9 in this article's Online Repository at www.jacionline.org), indicating that the association with hay fever risk per se is stronger than that with asthma risk per se. In the AAGC study the prevalence of allergic sensitization to a common allergen (ie, atopy) was only modestly higher for A-H+ cases (112/160 [70%]) when compared with A+H- cases (277/440 [63%]). As such, differences in atopy status might contribute to but are unlikely to fully explain the weaker association observed in the A+H- group. Second, the GSDMA and TSLP variants were associated with risk of asthma without hay fever (OR of 1.14 and 1.15 and 95% CI of 1.07-1.22 and 1.07-1.24, respectively) but less so with risk of hay fever without asthma (OR of 1.02 and 1.03 and 95% CI of 0.98-1.06 and 0.98-1.07, respectively). In both situations the difference in risk allele frequency between A+H- cases and A-H+ cases was statistically significant (P = .0003 and P = .004, respectively; see Table E9).
