The strongest association (P = 2.5x10-8) with ALT levels was with the PNPLA3 rs738409 (C>G) I148M variant (Figure 2A, Table 4), a missense polymorphism known as a quantitative trait locus (QTL) for ALT in the general population.

After adding PNPLA3 rs738409 genotype to a multivariate analysis for determinants of ALT levels, the PNPLA3 SNP accounted for 3.8% of ALT variability, and race group still remained an important risk factor (P = 3.7x10-11, 6.6x10-5 and 2.0x10-3 for whites, Hispanics and others vs. blacks, respectively), and explained 5.3% of the variability in ALT elevation after incorporating the PNPLA3 SNP (Table 3). Therefore, we performed three separate ancestry-specific GWAS among whites, blacks and Hispanics (Tables S2-S4) to identify additional possible race-specific genetic determinants of ALT, including the percentage of West African and Native American ancestries as covariates in the GWASs within blacks and Hispanics, respectively. Two variants, PIGV rs12748152 and GREB1 rs149940960, had P values approaching genome-wide significance and only in blacks (P = 1.3x10-8 and 2.0x10-8 respectively, Figure 2B, 3C&D). Coincidentally, the three subjects harboring the minor allele of GREB1 rs149940960 also had the minor allele of PIGV rs12748152. Both variants were associated with lower ALT only in blacks (P = 0.14 in whites and P = 0.59 in Hispanics for PIGV rs12748152, Figure 3C; the GREB1 rs149940960 was detected in blacks only). The PIGV rs12748152 had a higher MAF in whites (7.1%) than blacks (1.8%) and Hispanics (0.8%), whereas the GREB1 rs149940960 had MAF = 1.7% in blacks, in accordance with the general population frequency (1000 Genomes). In addition, when race structure was calculated with PCA and the first five principal components were used as covariates in each race-specific GWAS, the top SNPs and P values for association with ALT did not change substantially (Tables S2-S4), and PCA within blacks did not uncover any stratification among the patients carrying the different PIGV rs12748152 genotypes (Figure S4D). PNPLA3 rs6006460 (G>T) was previously reported to protect blacks from the development of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).

The frequency of this protective variant was highest in the blacks of our cohort (MAF = 11%) and thus may have counteracted the adverse effects of carrying the risk allele of PNPLA3 rs738409, therefore helping to explain why PNPLA3 rs738409 was not significantly associated with increased ALT among blacks (P = 0.20, Figures 3A&S3B). In blacks, the PNPLA3 rs738409 explained 1.3% of the variability in ALT level (P = 0.065) while PNPLA3 rs6006460 explained another 5.8% (P = 0.014).

Although many ALL medications can contribute to elevations in serum ALT, our multivariate analysis suggested that elevated post-induction chemotherapy ALT levels were linked to asparaginase exposure (Figures 1A&B, Table 3).

PIGV rs12748152 is an expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) for PIGV, ARID1A and ZDHHC18, and is also a QTL for cholesterol and triglycerides levels, whereas GREB1 rs149940960 is in the 3' untranslated region (3'-UTR) of GREB1, which regulates circulating levels of chemoattractant protein-1 (CCL2) and insulin-like growth factor binding protein 3 (IGFBF-3).
