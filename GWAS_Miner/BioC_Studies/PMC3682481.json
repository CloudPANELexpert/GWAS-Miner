Before association analyses, raw phenotypes of BSPs and ALM were adjusted for age, sex and height. To ensure adequate normality of quantitative traits, we applied an inverse normal transformation to each trait prior to association analysis. The inverse normal transformation reduces the impact of outliers and deviations from normality on statistical analysis. The transformation involves ranking all available phenotypes, transforming these ranks into quantiles and, finally, converting the resulting quantiles into normal deviates. Principal component analysis (PCA) was performed by EIGENSTRAT to calculate the principal components, and the ten default main eigenvectors were used as covariates to adjust raw phenotypic data for correction of population stratification. We first performed bivariate GWAS to detect associations between each SNP and two phenotypes in the discovery cohort, and we then conducted bivariate association analysis in the replication cohort. Haplotype association analyses of particular identified SNP groups were performed with both univariate and bivariate framework in the discovery and replication cohorts. An additive genetic model and a linear model were applied to both univariate and bivariate association analyses using the R software package (version 2.13.1). This method is expressed as the following formula, Yi = mu+ betaXi + epsiloni, for an individual i, Yi is a vector with length of 1 (for univariate analysis) or 2 (for bivariate analysis) coding the individual's phenotype, mu is the ground mean vector, beta's are the corresponding effects of the locus (SNP or haplotype block) under test; Xi is the genotype score at the locus of interest for individual i, and epsiloni is the vector of random error.
