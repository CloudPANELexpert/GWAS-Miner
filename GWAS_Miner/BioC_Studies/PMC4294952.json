Much research has been directed towards understanding the pharmacology of nicotine and its influence on smoking behavior. Smoking history, in the form of the number of cigarettes smoked per day (CPD), gathered through validated questionnaires, possibly in conjunction with plasma levels of nicotine metabolites, aid in evaluating tobacco smoke constituents uptake, individual differences in metabolism and lung cancer risk. Surprisingly, notable racial/ethnic differences in lung cancer risk occur among smokers. Moreover these differences persist even after adjustment for smoking rates (i.e. cigarettes/day) and smoking duration. For example, in comparison to European Americans, African American and Native Hawaiian smokers have higher overall risks of lung cancer at relatively low rates of consumption (e.g. 10 and 20 CPD), while Japanese Americans and Latinos tend to have lower risks than European Americans at this same level of smoking. These noted disparities in lung cancer risk among ethnic groups may be related to differences in internal dose and metabolism and may result from common genetic variation. Since nicotine is the known addictive component of cigarette smoke, understanding individual variation in nicotine metabolism is likely to be important in understanding both inter-individual and racial/ethnic differences in smoking behavior, the resulting exposure to tobacco carcinogens and lung cancer susceptibility.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 3495, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The primary pathway of nicotine metabolism is conversion to cotinine. Typically 80% of nicotine is metabolized to cotinine via cytochrome P450 2A6 (CYP2A6)-catalyzed C-oxidation. CYP2A6 also catalyzes the oxidation of cotinine to trans-3'-hydroxycotinine (3-HCOT). The other pathways of nicotine metabolism, N-oxidation and N-glucuronidation each typically contribute < 10 % to total metabolism, although, in some individuals N-glucuronidation may account for > 40% of the excreted nicotine metabolites. UGT2B10 and UGT1A4 both catalyze nicotine and cotinine N-glucuronidation, however UGT2B10 is a significantly more efficient catalyst and appears to be the enzyme responsible for nicotine and cotinine glucuronidation in smokers. 3-HCOT is O-glucuronidated, a reaction catalyzed, at least in part, by UGT2B17 an enzyme that does not catalyze N-glucuronidation. In urine, the sum of nicotine, cotinine, 3-HCOT and their respective glucuronide conjugates, referred to as \"nicotine equivalents\" account for 85-90% of total nicotine uptake.

Smokers self-modulate their tobacco consumption to maintain the desired effects and optimal concentrations of nicotine in the brain. A smoker with a slow rate of metabolism would likely smoke less or extract a lower nicotine dose per cigarette to achieve the same plasma level of nicotine as someone who metabolizes nicotine more quickly. Both CYP2A6 activity and genotype are associated with CPD in Japanese and smokers of European ancestry. Nicotine glucuronidation is of interest as another possible modulator of smoking behavior, and we previously reported that smokers who carry the UGT2B10 Asp67Tyr variant, which is associated with reduced nicotine and cotinine N-glucuronidation, excrete lower levels of nicotine equivalents.

The significant variation in metabolism across the ethnic groups within this cohort was recently reported. As reported previously, nicotine C-oxidation was lower in Japanese Americans and Native Hawaiians compared to European Americans, whereas nicotine and cotinine N-glucuronidation was lower in African Americans. The large number of subjects and their varied nicotine metabolism in this cohort allowed us to comprehensively assess the relationship of nicotine glucuronidation to smoking intensity. Since the N-glucuronidation of cotinine and nicotine is catalyzed by the same enzymes, we have used both nicotine and cotinine glucuronidation phenotypes to identify genetic variation in glucuronidation activity, then used the genetic model developed to test the relationship of glucuronidation to nicotine equivalents. Nicotine and cotinine glucuronidation levels in smokers urine is correlated, however the correlation will depend on the other pathways of nicotine and cotinine metabolism, primarily CYP2A6-catalyzed oxidation. Due to the greater catalytic efficiency of CYP2A6 -catalyzed nicotine oxidation relative to cotinine oxidation, the extent of cotinine glucuronidation will be less influenced by variation in CYP2A6 activity then will nicotine glucuronidation.

However, nicotine glucuronidation may account for up to 40% of the nicotine equivalents excreted by smokers. UGT2B10 catalyzes both nicotine and cotinine glucuronidation, and our analysis has determined that a high fraction of individual variation of cotinine glucuronidation is explained by genetic differences, which can be parsimoniously characterized using a genetic score of 15 SNPs from 9 chromosomes with SNPs near UGT2B10 showing the strongest associations.

The fraction of variability in cotinine glucuronidation explained by the genetic score ranges from 55% for African Americans to 19% for Japanese Americans. The high predictive value in African Americans reflects that the most influential of the SNPs (rs294777) included is only common (22%) in African Americans and is not present in European Americans, Japanese Americans, or Native Hawaiians. The predictive value in African Americans also may arguably be driven by a similar pattern of association with the UGT2B10 splice variant, which has frequency 35% in African Americans and from 0.1-8.0% in the other groups. The much lower predictive value of the genetic score in Japanese Americans may be due to the higher prevalence of CYP2A6 null variants in this group. We previously reported that CYP2A6 alleles contribute to variation in plasma nicotine glucuronide levels among European Americans, and in the subjects of this study, the CYP2A6 ratio for Japanese Americans was half the ratio for African Americans. In both Japanese Americans and Native Hawaiians low CYP2A6 activity is associated with decreased nicotine equivalents. This relationship may explain the inverse relationship between nicotine equivalents and nicotine glucuronidation that we see with these two groups, since decreased CYP2A6-catalyzed nicotine C-oxidation results in increased nicotine N-glucuronidation. Genotyping of common CYP2A6 alleles in the current study is on-going (CYP2A6 is not well covered by GWAS arrays) and these data, with additional nicotine metabolism phenotypes and the GWAS data will be used to gain a more complete understanding of the genetics of nicotine metabolism and tobacco use.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 32799, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The ethnic differences in nicotine and cotinine glucuronidation are interesting, but do not appear to be directly related to the differences in cancer risk seen between the five racial/ethnic groups.
