The SNP was not associated with the alcoholism phenotype per se (in cases versus controls) in that study, although it was in another study.

However, 45.0% (391/868) of our significant SNPs met much less stringent criteria (p<0.05) in the alcohol dependent-only analysis. P-values were significantly correlated across the analyses (p=0.0016, F=10.0, adjusted r2=0.010), suggesting not only that the comorbid phenotype and alcohol dependence alone are highly correlated, but also that the former is also influenced by many genetic variants that are not independently associated with alcohol dependence on its own. Thus, many of the variants reported here might be specific to susceptibility for only the comorbid phenotype, while others predispose to alcohol dependence or depressive syndrome in the absence of the other. This finding is consistent with previous reports. Many genes have been associated with alcohol dependence or depression but not the other (for reviews, see, and some genes - notably those related to monoaminergic neurotransmitters - have been associated with both (for a review, see. Our results are indicative of an additional layer of complexity - the existence of genetic variants predisposing to specifically to comorbidity, but which are not associated with either disorder on its own. We also explored the possibility that the comorbid cases simply represent a more severe subset of the alcohol dependent cases. Among the full COGA GWAS sample, 66% of the total alcohol dependent cases met criteria for an illicit drug dependence (a phenotype known to capture a more severe subset of cases in COGA,, as compared to 67% of the comorbid cases. However, the comorbid cases did endorse significantly more alcohol dependence symptoms than cases with alcohol dependence-only in the full EA sample (mean symptom count=5.8 and 5.3, respectively; p<0.01); additional analyses indicate that the male portion of the sample drove this difference. Thus, it is possible that some of our results are attributable to a slightly more severe level of alcohol dependence. We also note that, because the controls used for the AD+/MD- analysis are the same as those used in the primary analysis, these results should not be considered unbiased, as a portion of the overlap between results could be attributable to idiosyncrasies of the control sample.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 29922, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "We recognize a number of limitations to the current study. First, our analyses were limited to European Americans and might not be generalizable to other populations. Replication in other samples is essential. Second, our gene ontology analysis might not be entirely unbiased, since they do not adjust for gene size (Wang et al., 2010): relatively large genes (including many of those expressed in the brain) span more markers than small genes, and are thus more likely to harbor markers meeting our significance criterion by chance alone. Third, our \"cases\" include individuals who do not meet full DSM-IV criteria for an independent major depressive episode, in that many experienced depressive symptoms under the influence of alcohol or drugs (N=85 females and N=201 males of the total N of 467 cases). It is unclear how such a distinction might influence our results. Previous work suggests that substance-induced and independent depressions might be etiologically distinct; in addition, although the comorbid phenotype might have a heritable component, the genetics underlying this phenotype could be distinct from those underlying a comorbid phenotype of alcohol dependence and independent depression. In this case, the lack of distinction between independent and induced depression in the current study could be problematic. Unfortunately, our sample sizes are not large enough to conduct meaningful analyses on depressive symptoms that occur only within or only outside the context of alcohol/drug use. Furthermore, the mixed nature of the depressive episodes, and the fact that a number of cases met diagnostic criteria for abuse or dependence on other substances, reflects the nature of these disorders: they often appear in conjunction with other psychiatric problems, particularly in a clinical setting. To this end, we also recognize the possibility that the genes implicated in the current report are actually indexing risk to behavioral disinhibition rather than comorbid AD and depressive syndrome per se: the high prevalence of illicit substance use disorders among cases suggests that these individuals' various substance and mood-related problems could have developed through high levels of disinhibition, which is manifesting in various ways. Again, due to sample size limitations, we are unable to address this directly.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 32270, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "In summary, we report results from the first GWAS of a comorbid depressive syndrome/alcohol dependence phenotype.

Multiple genes involved in glutamate function are associated with case/control status in our sample, as are other genes involved in neural processes. These results suggest that the comorbid phenotype is influenced by genetic variants somewhat distinct from those influencing alcohol dependence on its own.
