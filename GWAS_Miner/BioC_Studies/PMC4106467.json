Growing evidence suggests that telomere length plays a critical role in cellular aging. As loss of telomeric DNA is impacted by cell division and oxidative stress, and induces cellular senescence, telomere length has been postulated as a biomarker of senescence and human aging in many published studies. Inter-individual variation in telomere length at birth and subsequent years is attributed to by both genetic and environmental factors that start in utero. Ethnic differences in the relative leukocyte telomere length (RTL) have been reported in multi-ethnic studies where populations such as African Americans and Hispanics had significant age-associated differences in RTL than Caucasian participants.

The difference in allele frequencies between Sikhs and Europeans could have contributed to non-replication of this association. Also, the association of the established TERC variant (rs10936599) is in opposite direction in Sikhs from the Europeans (see Supplementary Table 6), suggests a further evidence that there may be population-specific causal variant not in LD with these SNPs from these genes. A similar population-specific association was observed in our T2D GWAS in which a novel signal for T2D susceptibility represented by a directly genotyped SNP in the SGCG gene (rs9552911, P=1.82x10-8) found in the Sikhs was monomorphic in subjects of European ancestry (Saxena et al).

First, variability across studies due to well-known limitations of telomere length measurement techniques, could have contributed to non-replication in Caucasians; the mean RTL varied widely across studies (Supplementary Table 2B). Second, the presence of population heterogeneity and variation in observed telomere length has resulted in significant heterogeneity in global meta-analysis. Notably, most replication cohorts had 9-20% smokers whereas our Sikh population is a strictly non-smoking population, and gene-environment interactions with smoking may have obscured true association signals (Supplementary Table 2B). Third, a significant proportion of gender bias existed in most Caucasian replication cohorts including 91% females in UKTWIN, 100% females in NHS, 100% males in PLCO and UKCVD, and 72% males in MDACC compared to AIDHS/SDS (55% males) which could have partly contributed in non-replication as shorter RTL correlates remarkably with male gender in Sikhs as well as in previous studies (see Supplementary Table 2B). Finally, performing analysis from findings derived from T2D case control study with cohorts including prostate cancer survivors and post-menopausal women etc. could have resulted in replication bias in addition to other factors. For example, shorter telomeres in cancer cases due to disease-related secondary effects may reduce power to detect a genetic effect. Differences in LD between marker and causal SNPs in Sikhs and non-Sikh replication cohorts has certainly contributed to non-replication in the European sample and to the limited association of 6 European SNPs in Sikh populations.
