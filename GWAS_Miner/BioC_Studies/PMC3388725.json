The first generation \"typical\" antipsychotics (e.g., haloperidol) were introduced in the 1950s. Despite treatment with these antipsychotics, many schizophrenia patients do not improve or relapse frequently. Furthermore, these drugs may produce adverse reactions such as extrapyramidal side effects (EPS, i.e., involuntary movements). Clozapine was (re-)introduced in 1989 marking the advent of the second generation \"atypical\" antipsychotics. Although clozapine has enhanced therapeutic effects in patients who respond poorly to treatment with typical antipsychotics, it is associated with a serious risk of agranulocytosis. Other second generation antipsychotics such as olanzapine have therefore become the first line treatment for schizophrenia. These second generation drugs are, however, no panaceas. They too lack efficacy in a substantial group of patients and are associated with, for example, metabolic side effects that increase risk of cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Due to effectiveness in individual patients, low risk of metabolic side effects, and much lower costs, first generation antipsychotics are therefore still being prescribed as well.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 2844, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "EPS are a major consideration for prescribing, in particular first generation antipsychotics that are assumed to have a somewhat higher risk profile.

The complexity of EPS is illustrated by data showing that these side effects may occur at different times during antipsychotic treatment (acute vs. late EPS), may sometimes occur \"spontaneously' after antipsychotic treatment ended, or may be suppressed by continued antipsychotic treatment.

One of the SNPs, rs2126709, was located in the 3'UTR of ZNF202. This geneis a transcriptional repressor, controlling promoter elements found in for example apolipoprotein E (apoE), lipoprotein lipase (LPL), ATP binding cassette (ABC) transporters A1 and G1, proteolipid protein (PLP) and early growth response 3 (EGR3). ZNF202 has been linked to dyslipidemia, high-density lipoprotein control, and many genes under its control are involved in reverse cholesterol transport. Considering that, next to adiposity tissue, the brain has the highest lipid content and that the myelin sheets surrounding and protecting neurons consists of approximately 80% lipids, a well functioning regulation of the lipid metabolism is of particular importance for brain function. Furthermore, demyelination can lead to diseases with ataxia and other movement problems, such as multiple sclerosis. PLP1, which is also under the transcriptional control of ZNF202, is the predominant myelin protein present in the central nervous system. This gene has been associated with Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease in which involuntary movements, including parkinsonism, are among the major occurring symptoms. In addition, decreased mRNA expression of PLP1 has been observed in patients diagnosed with schizophrenia.
