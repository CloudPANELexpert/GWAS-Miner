We also showed that circulating sSEMA4D level was significantly higher in individuals with obesity compared to those without obesity. Based on ENCODE data, lead SNP rs80068415 displays marked transcriptional activity (flanking the active transcription start site) in a diverse population of T-cells (T- helper cells, primary T-cells, T-regulatory cells). This SNP also overlaps an enhancer in numerous tissues, including primary hematopoietic stem cells, and GATA2, a transcription factor bound by CHIP-seq. The C variant results in GATA2 motif disruption. No associated eQTL has been reported. The evidence from this study and the ENCODE data suggest that the C allele of r80068415 is probably not the causal variant but more likely tracking a regulatory process that is controlling putative obesity-related genes. rs80068415 is likely acting through either another functional SNP in LD with it or trans-regulatory elements affecting obesity-related gene function. Deep sequencing of SEMA4D in African ancestry populations along with the use of a range of functional genetic techniques including gene editing could help elucidate the mechanism(s) by which rs80068415 is associated with BMI in Africans and African Americans. Functionally, SEMA4D has been shown to play a role in cell-cell signaling, immune response, and bone formation. In the context of the findings of this paper, SEMA4D's role in immune response is promising given the association between inflammation and obesity. SEMA4D is a 150-kDa transmembrane glycoprotein expressed by platelets, activated B cells, dendritic cells, kidney, osteoclasts, and resting T-cells. When these cells are activated, SEMA4D is proteolytically cleaved, generating a biologically-active 120-kDa fragment with paracrine/autocrine properties. sSema4D is a pleiotropic protein that has also been associated with many other inflammatory/autoimmune diseases including multiple sclerosis and Non Alcoholic Steato-Hepatitis (NASH). Under these conditions SEMA4D seems to be upregulated at the protein level through the activation and differentiation of T-cells and promotion of Th1 (T helper 1) differentiation. In fact, T-cells have been shown to have an early and critical role in obesity. Obesity is associated with an increased accumulation of T-cells which are the major source of SEMA4D.

While there is evidence for the involvement of SEMA4D in inflammatory processes through the regulation of T-cells, this study is the first to implicate SEMA4D in obesity pathophysiology and to suggest that SEMA44D may be a key player in the triangular relationship between obesity, inflammation, and metabolic comorbidities especially IR.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 18894, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "In summary, we identified and replicated a novel variant in SEMA4D (rs80068415) that is significantly associated with BMI in African ancestry individuals.

The putative role of SEMA4D in obesity appears to involve regulation of the transcription start site. The lead SNP, rs80068415, is polymorphic in Africans but monomorphic in other 1000G populations, providing a potential explanation for why this association has not been observed in published GWAS of European and Asian populations. This work highlights the importance of conducting genomic studies in diverse populations and identifies a novel locus that may improve our understanding of BMI-related physiology.
