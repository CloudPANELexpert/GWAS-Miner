Familial studies support a genetic contribution to prognosis, but little evidence has been found for a proposed association between prognosis and the burden of susceptibility variants. To better characterise how genetic variation influences disease prognosis, we performed a within-cases genome-wide association study in two cohorts of patients with Crohn's disease. We identified four genome-wide significant loci, none of which showed any association with disease susceptibility. Conversely, the aggregated effect of all 170 disease susceptibility loci was not associated with prognosis.

For example, while NOD2 variants were initially associated with increased need for surgery in CD, this has since been attributed to their association with ileal disease (the distribution of CD that is more commonly treated with surgery as the procedure carries a lower morbidity).

Despite the breadth of this signal, conditioning on the lead SNP revealed only one associated haplotype (Fig. 2A). To assess whether specific HLA alleles were responsible for this genetic association, we imputed classical 4-digit HLA alleles and detected associations at multiple class I and class II genes. Notably, all of the associated alleles belonged to a single multigene haplotype, \"ancestral MHC 8.1\" (AH8.1; Fig. 2B). Indeed, the strength of each allelic association correlated with how specific that allele was to AH8.1 (Supplementary Fig. 4). To clarify the contribution of AH8.1 to the genetic signal, we performed cross-conditioning to assess the residual associations when the SNP analysis was conditioned on the lead AH8.1 allele (HLA-B*08:01) and vice versa. In both directions, cross-conditioning abrogated any association, demonstrating that inheritance of AH8.1 was the major contributor to the genetic signal (Fig. 2C, Supplementary Table 3). Carriers of this haplotype are known to exhibit impaired responses to vaccination and defects in T-cell activation, consistent with HLA-specific differences in antigen presentation. The increased frequency of this haplotype in good prognosis CD is therefore consistent with the notion that differential T-cell activation influences prognosis in immune-mediated disease. Interestingly, no association was observed at HLA-DRB1*01:03, the HLA allele that has by far the strongest association with CD susceptibility of any HLA allele or SNP (Fig. 2B, Supplementary Table 3).

These associations are therefore likely to be involved in the biology that determines prognosis in CD, as was shown for FOXO3. To further explore this underlying biology, we examined whether genes tagged by an extended list of prognosis-associated SNPs (meta P < 10-5) were enriched within specific biological pathways (Online Methods). Strong enrichment was observed for pathways that regulate innate and adaptive immune responses, and responses to micro-organisms (Fig. 3A). Similar results were obtained if SNPs within the extended MHC were removed (Supplementary Table 7). To identify the cell-types involved, we examined for tissue-specific enrichment using an expression atlas of primary human cells. Strong enrichment was observed in macrophages, followed by weaker signals in monocytes and dendritic cells (Fig. 3B, Supplementary Table 8). These mononuclear phagocytes play important roles in innate immunity and can initiate adaptive immune responses. Monocytes are also the cell-type in which the FOXO3 variant was biologically relevant.

There was also no correlation between the power to detect effects at these SNPs and the observed P values, consistent with the hypothesis that susceptibility variants are not individually associated with prognosis (Supplementary Fig. 7).
