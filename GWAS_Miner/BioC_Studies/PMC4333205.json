PACG results from elevated intraocular pressure as a consequence of iris-trabecular meshwork contact in the angle of the eye, hindering aqueous outflow. Whereas POAG is the more predominant form of glaucoma in Europeans and Africans, 80% of the estimated 15 million people afflicted with PACG live in Asia.

Epidemiological studies have suggested a genetic basis for PACG, and several candidate gene studies of modest sample sizes have investigated this possibility. However, the genetic determinants underlying individual susceptibility to PACG remain largely unknown. To identify sequence variants that confer susceptibility to PACG, we conducted a two-stage genome-wide association study (GWAS) and replication including 3,771 cases and 18,551 controls. Such staged study designs accompanied by meta-analysis have been well established. The discovery stage (stage 1) comprised 1,854 PACG cases and 9,608 controls recruited across 5 independent collections (Singapore, Hong Kong, India, Malaysia and Vietnam; Table 1). The replication stage (stage 2) comprised an additional 1,917 PACG cases and 8,943 controls across 6 independent collections (2 sites in China and 1 site each in Singapore, India, Saudi Arabia and the UK; Table 1).", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 2866, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "We applied uniform quality control filters for both individual samples and SNP markers across all five PACG case-control collections for stage 1 (see Online Methods and the Supplementary Note for detailed descriptions of the sample collections). From starting numbers of 1,925 PACG cases and 9,630 controls, genotype data on 493,501 SNPs were available for 1,854 PACG cases and 9,608 controls after stringent quality control filters were applied on SNPs and samples. Within each sample collection, we ensured that each PACG case had genetically matched controls, as visualized spatially using principal-component analysis (Supplementary Fig. 1). We contrasted the genotypes between PACG cases and healthy controls via single-SNP analysis using unconditional logistic regression fitted for genotype trend effects (1-degree-of-freedom score test). As the genetic matching between cases and controls is not perfect, we adjusted the association tests with the top axes of population ancestry to remove any residual population stratification that might be present (Online Methods) within each study collection, following standard procedures. This was followed by random-effects meta-analysis using inverse-variance weights. We observed no evidence of genomic inflation (lambdaGC = 1.0), thereby excluding the likelihood of significant cryptic population substructure between cases and controls. We observed association signals with genome-wide significance in PLEKHA7 (rs11024102) on chromosome 11 (Fig. 1 and Table 2; per-allele OR = 1.27; P = 1.43 x 10-8) with stage 1 data alone.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 4444, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "A total of 15 SNPs at 12 independent loci showing evidence of association with PACG exceeding P < 1 x 10-5 with no evidence of heterogeneity (I2 index = 0.0%) across the 5 sample collections in stage 1 were brought forward for replication genotyping in stage 2, which enrolled an additional 1,973 PACG cases and 9,066 controls. Similar quality control filters were applied to SNPs and samples in this stage, and 11 SNPs genotyped in a total of 1,917 PACG cases and 8,943 controls that passed quality control were brought forward for association analysis (Supplementary Table 1). Three SNP markers (rs11024102 in PLEKHA7, rs3753841 in COL11A1 and rs1015213) showed significant evidence of replication in stage 2 (3.72 x 10-5 <= P <= 1.77 x 10-4) and surpassed genome-wide significance in meta-analysis of all data from both stages (5.33 x 10-12 <= P <= 3.29 x 10-9; Table 2, Supplementary Fig. 2 and Supplementary Table 2). Regional association analysis for these three sequence variants clearly identified PLEKHA7 and COL11A1 as the likeliest candidate susceptibility genes for PACG at the associated regions in chromosomes 11 and 1, respectively, whereas rs1015213 was located in an intergenic region between PCMTD1 and ST18 (Fig. 2). A fourth SNP, rs3788317, in TXNRD2 showed nominal evidence of replication in stage 2 but did not reach genome-wide significance (Supplementary Table 1). Imputation analysis of stage 1 study collections using the most recent 1000 Genomes Project Asian reference panel revealed the association of multiple SNP markers, corroborating the genotyped SNPs with the most significant association at PLEKHA7 and COL11A1. Because of the rarity of rs1015213 in many Asian populations, imputation at this locus was less successful. We did not observe additional evidence of association with imputed SNPs over and above that already seen with directly genotyped SNP markers (Fig. 2). Conditional logistic regression did not reveal secondary signals of association at each of the three loci associated with genome-wide significance, suggesting that the reported most significant SNPs largely account for the observed disease associations (Supplementary Tables 3-5). Of note, no evidence of association was observed at loci previously reported to be associated with POAG (Supplementary Table 6). As there is a paucity of information on the identified candidate genes in the eye, we also examined the expression of PLEKHA7, COL11A1, PCMTD1 and ST18 in several eye tissues. We note expression of PLEKHA7, COL11A1 and PCMTD1 in tissues that form the iridocorneal angle, such as the cornea, iris and trabecular meshwork. In contrast, the expression profile of ST18 was more limited. Although strongly expressed in the lens and cornea, ST18 was not expressed in the trabecular meshwork or iris (Supplementary Fig. 3).", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 7299, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "PLEKHA7 (NM_175058) encodes pleckstrin homology domain-containing protein 7, which is critical for the maintenance and stability of adherens junctions. In adult tissues, the adherens junctions maintain tissue homeostasis and, along with tight junctions, control epithelial and endothelial paracellular permeability. In the eye, tight junctions and adherens junctions have an essential role in structures of particular relevance to glaucoma, such as the ciliary body, iris, aqueous humor outflow system and choroid, by providing a barrier to fluid leakage. Factors such as attenuated reduction in iris volume with pupillary dilation and exaggerated choroidal expansion have been proposed to have key roles in the spectrum of angle closure pathogenesis. Given the role of PLEKHA7 in maintaining a protein complex that regulates paracellular permeability, we speculate that it may be involved in the pathophysiology of angle closure related to aberrant fluid dynamics. Recently, a GWAS on blood pressure in more than 60,000 individuals determined that SNPs within this gene were associated with systolic blood pressure, a systemic risk factor for glaucoma. The SNP associated with PACG in our study is located 80-100 kb upstream of the SNPs associated with blood pressure. We did not observe evidence of association between rs11024074 in PLEKHA7, the SNP reported to be strongly associated with systemic hypertension, and PACG status in our stage 1 meta-analysis (P = 0.13; per-allele OR = 1.11). The pairwise linkage disequilibrium (LD) between rs11024074 (SNP for systemic hypertension) and rs11024102 (SNP for PACG) was very weak (D = 0.154, r2 = 0.009), suggesting that different genetic polymorphisms could underlie the subtly different mechanisms that control distinct phenotypes, even though the underlying gene is a common denominator.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 9144, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "COL11A1 (NM_001190709, NM_001854, NM_080629 and NM_080630) encodes one of the two alpha chains of type XI collagen. Pathogenic mutations in COL11A1 cause Marshall syndrome (MIM 154780), Stickler syndrome, type 2 (STL2; MIM 604841) or Stickler-like syndrome. All are associated with ocular, orofacial, auditory and skeletal manifestations. Notably, one of the ocular features of these diseases is nonprogressive axial myopia, which is likely caused by an aberrant fibrillar collagen matrix in the sclera. Our data suggest that common variations in COL11A1 are associated with PACG, and eyes predisposed to PACG are generally hyperopic, having a shorter axial length and a crowded anterior segment. Therefore, the causal variants in COL11A1 that predispose to PACG may alter its expression, such that there is the opposite effect to that observed in myopic eyes. COL11A1 is also expressed in human ocular trabecular meshwork cells, and this expression could be important in regulating the drainage of the aqueous humor from the eye. Therefore, the aberrant activity of the encoded gene product, albeit representing a mild alteration, could affect multiple sites within the eye of individuals with PACG.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 10345, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The third locus, rs1015213 on chromosome 8q, is located within an intergenic region 120 kb upstream of PCMTD1 (NM_052937) and 130 kb downstream of ST18 (NM_014682). PCMTD1 encodes protein-l-isoaspartate O-methyltransferase domain-containing protein 1, whose function remains relatively unknown. ST18 encodes the suppression of tumorigenicity 18 protein and has been shown to be significantly downregulated in breast cancer cell lines. More recent studies have also shown it to be a mediator of apoptosis and inflammation. The LD block where rs1015213 is located extends into PCMTD1 (Supplementary Fig. 4c) but not into ST18, suggesting that PCMTD1 is the more likely candidate susceptibility gene for PACG at this locus. The minor allele frequency of rs1015213 was low (between 1-3%) in many of the sample collections (Supplementary Table 2), particularly in individuals of Chinese and Vietnamese descent. We are thus mindful that residual population stratification could confound the genetic association in these collections. We were somewhat reassured that 10 out of the 11 PACG sample collections showed the same direction of effect for rs1015213. Furthermore, the overall meta-analysis for all sample collections showed only mild heterogeneity (I2 index = 19%), which was not statistically significant between the collections (P value for heterogeneity = 0.19), thus arguing against population stratification as the cause of the observed association. In terms of the biological consequences of all three loci associated with genome-wide significance, the lack of definitive biological verification and the absence of a clear mechanism mean that there remains some ambiguity as to the true causal gene(s) involved in PACG pathogenesis, although verification from independent studies and database searches (for example, UniGene (see URLs) and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) data sets) of the expression of PLEKHA7 and COL11A1 in ocular tissues lends some support to the idea that both genes have some role in PACG pathogenesis.

Our stage 2 replication involved averaging across separate results from 6 independent collections totaling 1,917 PACG cases and 8,943 controls. The inclusion of multiple populations provided insurance against false positive results, which could arise from possible substructure in some study collections. Notably, the replication collections showed evidence of association for the original stage 1 GWAS signals with consistent direction of effect and minimal heterogeneity. We note that, even in the UK replication sample that is the most distantly related to the other sample collections, the ORs for all three PACG-associated loci were no different from the stage 1, stage 2 or overall summary effect sizes (Supplementary Fig. 2). We did not observe any evidence of association at previously reported loci for POAG that surpassed genome-wide significance, despite sufficient statistical power to detect the previously reported effect sizes (Online Methods). This reinforces clinical and epidemiological data that indicate that PACG and POAG are distinct disease entities with different molecular signatures underlying their pathogenic mechanisms. As PACG is related to nanophthalmos, we also examined our stage 1 association results for all three reported nanophthalmos-associated loci that have been reported to date from genetic linkage studies (NNO1 at 11p, NNO2 at 11q23 and NNO3 at 2q11-14). Although rs11024102 in PLEKHA7 was found within the broad NNO1 locus that spans ~50 Mb, it was located outside of the 95% confidence interval (the interval encompassing a 1-unit drop in the logarithm of odds (LOD) score) for the locus. As the resolution for multiallelic microsatellite mapping was low, we are unable to rule out a role for PLEKHA7 in susceptibility to nanophthalmos.

The usefulness of fine mapping across ancestry groups, with the aim to localize association signals in advance of replication, could not be applied here because of the similar LD pattern across the five study collections comprising stage 1 (Supplementary Fig. 4). This is probably not unexpected, as they share Asian descent. In conclusion, we identified three new loci for PACG, a major blinding disease with largely unresolved causal mechanisms.
