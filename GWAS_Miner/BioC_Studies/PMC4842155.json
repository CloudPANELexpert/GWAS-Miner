We combined regression coefficients and P-values obtained from screening and replication phases using Cochran's method, and identified as significant those SNPs with combined P-values < 5x10-8. We checked for residual population stratification by examining the inflation factor lambdaGC, and Q-Q plots of percentiles of the observed distribution of test statistics versus those expected under the global null hypothesis (see Supplementary Materials). Further adjustment for age and immunosuppressive status resulted in negligible changes in the odds-ratios for the top 10 SNPs in Table 1.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 22852, "infons": {"section_type": "METHODS", "type": "title_2"}, "text": "Data accessibility", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 22871, "infons": {"section_type": "METHODS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Genotypes used in this GWAS have been registered with dbGAP; (Study Accession: phs000674.v1.p1).", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 22968, "infons": {"section_type": "METHODS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "All study procedures were approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Kaiser Foundation Research Institute.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 23082, "infons": {"section_type": "SUPPL", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "Supplementary Material", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 23105, "infons": {"section_type": "SUPPL", "type": "footnote"}, "text": "Conflict of Interest: The authors state no conflicts of interest.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 23171, "infons": {"section_type": "SUPPL", "type": "footnote"}, "text": "Supplementary Materials: The Supplementary Materials section is linked to the online version of the paper at http://www.nature.com/jid", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 23306, "infons": {"section_type": "SUPPL", "type": "footnote"}, "text": "This is a PDF file of an unedited manuscript that has been accepted for publication.
