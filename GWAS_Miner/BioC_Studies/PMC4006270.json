Because the variants at each of the loci could have other biological effects that could impact on their association with CAD through LTL (and possibly explain why the NAF1 locus may be trending in the opposite direction), some caution is required in the interpretation of this association.

Telomerase activity was assayed by the Telo TAGGG Telomerase PCR ELISA kit (Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN) (TRAP assay) as per the manufacturers' protocol using 2x10-5 cells/assay. An extract from 2000 cells were used for TRAP reactions. Sample telomerase activity was expressed as ratio of telomerase activity value divided by control HK293 telomerase activity value from 1000 cells. Intra-assay CV was5.9% and inter-assay CV is 4.8%. Telomerase activity was log transformed to obtain better approximations of the normal distribution prior to analysis. Association analyses with genotype were performed using regression and an additive model with adjustment for age, sex and ethnicity.
