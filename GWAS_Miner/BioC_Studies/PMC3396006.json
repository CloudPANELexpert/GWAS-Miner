The novel SNP identified in this GWAS, rs2242652, is weakly correlated with the previously reported rs401681 (r2= 0.19) and showed a much stronger association with PrCa risk in our original GWAS (P =9.8 x10-11 in stages 1, 3 and CGEMS vs. P=0.001 for rs401681).

Modification of the ORs by age was assessed using a case-only analysis, assessing the association between age and SNP genotype in the cases using polytomous regression.
