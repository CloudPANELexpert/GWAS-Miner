The etiology of AD involves both environmental and genetic factors, and the disorder has a heritability of around 50%. The aim of the present study was to identify susceptibility genes for AD by performing a genome-wide association study (GWAS). The sample comprised 1,333 male in-patients with severe DSM-IV AD and 2,168 controls. These included 487 patients and 1,358 controls from a previous GWAS study by our group. All individuals were of German descent. Single marker tests and a polygenic score based analysis to assess the combined contribution of multiple markers with small effects were performed. The SNP rs1789891, which is located between the ADH1B and ADH1C genes, achieved genome-wide significance (p=1.27E-8; OR=1.46). Other markers from this region were also associated with AD, and conditional analyses indicated that these made a partially independent contribution. The SNP rs1789891 is in complete linkage disequilibrium with the functional Arg272Gln variant (p=1.24E-7, OR=1.31) of the ADH1C gene, which has been reported to modify the rate of ethanol oxidation to acetaldehyde in vitro. A polygenic score based approach produced a significant result (p=9.66E-9).

Despite extensive research, it is unclear why only a proportion of all individuals exposed to alcohol become addicted. Elucidation of this point is important for the development of successful prevention and treatment strategies for AD. Previous research has shown that susceptibility to AD is partly genetic, and has a heritability of 40-60%. The introduction of high-density SNP chips has enabled the systematic investigation of common variation in the human genome, and a large number of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for a wide range of complex disorders have been published to date. These investigations have implicated new variants, genes, and pathways. However, they have also demonstrated that sample size is crucial in detecting findings with genome-wide significance due to a combination of two effects. Firstly, effects of individual (common) variants are typically rather small and, secondly, as a consequence of the large number of simultaneously investigated markers on the arrays, the single marker analyses have to be corrected for the large number of tests, allowing only those markers with the strongest effects to surpass the level of genome-wide significance.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 2982, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Recently, we reported a GWAS conducted in 487 male inpatients with DSM-IV AD and 1,358 population based control individuals (for a detailed description see).

A polygenic component is defined as the presence of a multitude of small genetic effects (with individual effect sizes below the threshold for detection at the level of single markers within a GWAS), being measured as a summed effect. The latter method has recently been applied successfully to test for a polygenic contribution to schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. For a detailed explanation of this approach see. In simple terms, the polygenic score approach uses information concerning association findings for several ten thousand SNPs from a discovery sample to calculate a summary score for each individual in a target sample. Subsequent analyses are performed to test whether the cases in the target sample have different scores to the controls in the target sample. Therefore, a GWAS is first carried out in a discovery sample. Following this step, the polygenic score for each individual in the target sample is calculated by counting the number of reference alleles (e.g. risk alleles or minor alleles) of this subject on any of the included loci. This number is weighted by multiplication with the log(OR) of the respective marker in the discovery sample. The sum of all of these products is then calculated and divided by the number of included loci. Finally, the association of this score with disease status is tested in the target sample by its inclusion as a predictor in a logistic regression model.

Existing knowledge of the biochemical function of the ADHs and the results of animal studies provide further strong support for the hypothesis that the ADHs are involved in the etiology of AD. The ADHs are involved in the enzymatic degradation of ingested ethanol, a process which results in the toxic intermediate acetaldehyde. This is normally metabolized rapidly to acetate, in a reaction that is catalyzed by the aldehyde dehydrogenases (ALDHs). Accumulation of acetaldehyde in the blood causes the so called \"flushing reaction\", which leads to the avoidance of alcohol consumption. This is the rationale for the use of the ALDH inhibitor disulfiram in the treatment of AD. A naturally occurring reduction in ALDH2 activity due to a functional mutation (Glu504Lys, rs671) in this gene, which is highly prevalent in Asians, protects a substantial proportion of this population from AD.

Of these, class I gene products (ADH1A, ADH1B, and ADH1C) account for most of the capacity of the liver for ethanol oxidation. High LD has been reported for several variants across these genes.

This is in complete LD (D'=1.0, r2=0.27, HapMap rel 24 CEU) with rs1693482 (Arg272Gln), a common functional amino acid substitution in the ADH1C gene. An Australian study found that Arg272Gln was associated with \"amount of alcohol consumption\". This finding is compatible with the hypothesis that increased ADH activity may be protective against AD. Since Arg272Gln was not present in our data set, it was necessary to impute this marker. Based on the imputed genotypes, the higher-function 272Arg variant corresponding to the protective allele C of rs1789891 in the present GWAS was indeed found to be the protective allele in our sample. However, the association with Arg272Gln, (p=1.24E-7, OR=1.31) was not stronger than the association with rs1789891 (p=1.27E-8; OR=1.46).

We were able to show that these variants which may confer vulnerability through many different biological mechanisms, act across different samples. Since the effect sizes of individual risk alleles involved in polygenic susceptibility will be low, it will be difficult to distinguish true risk effects from false positives at the level of individual genes.
