Because of this, temporal lobe atrophy is typically easier to detect after controlling for overall brain volume, because the effects of wide variations in head size have been largely removed. In addition, work by Paling et al. has advocated the use of 9 parameter linear registration, especially in multi-site imaging studies, as it can correct for scanner voxel size variations in large studies involving multiple sites, scanners, and acquisition sequences, such as this one (these are typically mild and may result in variations of 1-3% in brain volume, but they add to measurement error).", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 38377, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Even so, as we have noted in our prior studies, there is however some evidence for non-proportional scaling of brain subregions relative to the overall size of the brain.

Several factors empower the design. Scans of 742 healthy elderly control, MCI, and AD subjects allowed accurate structural measurements across a broad phenotypic range. The genome-wide analyses were not split within diagnostic groups as the goal was to present as broad a phenotypic continuum as possible. Though it is possible that diagnostic groups represent distinct genetic backgrounds and may therefore confound the interpretation of our results, here we operate under the hypothesis that associations are evident regardless of diagnostic group, but may be more pronounced in disease. In interpreting findings in this mixed cohort, it cannot be ruled out that the SNP effects are influencing the normal aging process independently of AD pathology. In fact, the SNP effects may even be present in young adults, prior to substantial brain aging. Conversely, it cannot be ruled out that such associations are driven by the presence of different diagnostic categories, and might not be found if only normal subjects were examined. In the future, when the sample sizes are greatly increased as more imaging and genetic data are collected, it should be possible to further stratify the image database to understand (1) which specific sub-populations show a detectable SNP effect, and (2) which processes (AD, aging, early development, or all of them) are influenced by the SNPs of interest. At present we have a more restricted goal of finding SNPs that influence brain structure in a mixed cohort of healthy and ill subjects, including those with AD and those who are healthy. Treating this cohort as a continuum is arguably more defensible than (for example) studying a mixed cohort of subjects with a Mendelian genetic illness (such as Fragile X) and controls. This is because for Alzheimer's disease, a continuum is arguably evident in that some of cellular processes characteristic of AD (e.g., increased cerebral amyloid load) are typically present to some degree in those not yet diagnosed. For example, healthy elderly subjects often show some hallmarks of AD pathology at a subclinical level (amyloid plaques and tau neurofibrillary tangles) that can be detected on imaging and negatively correlate with cognitive status. As such, the effect of pathology on the SNP associations cannot be disentangled easily by focusing only on controls, as many harbor pathology at a subclinical level. Additionally, the boundary between MCI and AD is based on cognitive tests and observations of daily living that are easy to assess clinically, not biologically based boundaries. The continuum from healthy aging to mild impairment to disease gives the broadest phenotypic range and therefore the highest power to detect the genetic determinants of brain volume in old age, including variants that may have relevance to AD. Therefore splitting between diagnostic groups is likely to reduce power through both fewer subjects and a smaller phenotypic range.
