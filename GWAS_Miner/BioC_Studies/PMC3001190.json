The small level of associations observed in Europeans by others could also be explained by low levels of African ancestry in the cases considered or even by the fact that Southern European populations have a 1-3% level of African ancestry due to migrations which took place 50-70 generations ago (private communication with Nick Patterson).", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 18138, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Interestingly, it has been recently shown that mutations in the C-terminal region of APOL1 interfere with the interaction of the Serum Resistance-Associated (SRA) protein with APOL1, which is the mechanism by which Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense evades the trypanolytic activity of APOL1 that normally confers resistance to the parasite.
