In addition, statistical assessments of heterogeneity did not suggest large variation in SNP effects across studies. Another limitation is confounding, either from cryptic population stratification or unmeasured PR risk factors. For example, one potential confounder we were unable to consider was atrial size, given widespread unavailability of echocardiographs. However, we adjusted for BMI, height, and systolic blood pressure, the major contributors to left atrial size. Regarding the potential for bias from population substructure, we adjusted for principal components in study-specific regression models and applied genomic control.

One exception is a PR GWA study by Smith et al. including6,247 participants from four cohorts. Here, we extend this meta-analysis by including an additional 7,168participants fromsix cohorts in order to identify novel loci influencing PR in African Americans. In addition to generalizing four PR loci in ARHGAP24, MEIS1, TBX5, and CAV1 to populations of African ancestry, we identified one novel signal in ITGA9 and two additional independent and genome-wide significant secondary signals in the 3p21 region that harbors SCN5A and SCN10A. Our findings highlight the ability to map novel loci in African Americans, the generalizability of loci associated with PR across populations of African, European and Asian descent, and the new mechanistic insights on biologic processes underlying PR.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}], "annotations": [], "relations": []}]}
