They activate nuclear transcription factor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARalpha) which is predominantly expressed in tissues that metabolize fatty acids, such as the liver, kidney, heart and muscle. Upon activation, PPARalpha binds with retinoid X receptor (RXR) and the resulting dimer anneals to specific PPARalpha response elements in the genome, modulating expression of target lipid metabolism genes. Activated PPARalpha ultimately upregulates plasma lipoprotein lipase (LPL) activity, raises apolipoprotein A-I and apolipoprotein A-II levels, and reduces apolipoprotein CIII, all of which enhance the clearance of circulating triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (TRLs). In addition, fibrates promote a shift in the density of low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) particles towards larger, more buoyant particles that are less susceptible to oxidation and have increased affinity for the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDL-R). Among the fibrate class, fenofibrate has demonstrated TG and LDL-C lowering effects in the majority of subjects, though the magnitude of response is highly variable (24-55% lowering for TGs and 6-35% lowering for LDL-C), whereas its effects on HDL-C are typically positive (8-38%).", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 4109, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Despite effective lipid lowering, studies have demonstrated both positive and mixed results of fibrates in terms of cardiovascular disease (CVD) protection.

In contrast, evaluation of fenofibrate in patients with type 2 diabetes in the Fenofibrate Intervention and Event Lowering in Diabetes (FIELD) study failed to demonstrate a positive outcome for the primary endpoint (CHD death or non-fatal myocardial infarction) and produced mixed effects for several of the secondary endpoints. The Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD) trial of fenofibrate, which added fenofibrate to baseline simvastatin therapy among persons with type 2 diabetes, reported a statistically insignificant 8% reduction in cardiovascular events. Reasons for the mixed conclusions are still being debated; however, it is apparent that there are large inter-individual variations in TG and other lipid fraction responses to fibrate therapy.

There are several transcription factor binding sites in this gene-rich region as evidenced by Transcription factor CHIP-Seq analysis and HMR Conserved Transcription Factor Binding Sites. Importantly, a binding site for PPARA can be found in the 3' region of GATAD2A. Two clinically associated SNPS are also (rs137852869 and rs267605377, both for cancer types). Examination of this region using the Broad Institute HaploReg tool v4.1 http://www.broadinstitute.org/mammals/haploreg/haploreg.php) provided further evidence of protein binding sites, motif changes, NHGRI GWAS hits and expression QTLs. We have provided the results for each of the statistically significant LDL-C variants in Supplemental Digital Content 8. Notably, a SNP (rs58434384) in tight LD with our top finding changes a motif for PPAR binding with ZNF101.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 24898, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "Discussion", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 24909, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Whether fenofibrate treatment prevents CVD in high risk populations remains a topic of debate in the medical community. It is suspected that large inter-individual variation in lipid fraction response to fenofibrate has contributed to mixed results for CVD prevention reported by clinical studies. Since there is evidence that fenofibrate treatment may offer cardioprotective effects for some individuals, research focused on identifying treatment responsive persons is a worthy pursuit. To the best of our knowledge, the role of genetic factors in fenofibrate response has only been considered at the candidate gene level, making this the first genome-wide study of treatment response using data collected on 1600 participants from two well characterized clinical trials. Overall, our findings support a role for a known lipid locus on chromosome 19 in the region of PBX4. Further validation is needed to help confirm the importance of this region for fenofibrate response across racial groups in order to determine whether markers in the region could be useful for lipid lowering treatment strategies in the future.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 26027, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Several SNPs and indels in or near MAU2, PBX4, and ATP13A1 are listed in Table 2. Three of the SNPs replicated with marginal significance in a small group of Hispanics from ACCORD. No markers from Table 2 replicated in African Americans from ACCORD. Expansion of replication in the region surrounding the index SNPs listed in Table 2 among ACCORD Hispanics further suggests this locus may be important for LDL-C fenofibrate response (see Supplemental Table, Supplemental Digital Content 4). SNPs in or near PBX4 and nearby ZNF101 have been associated with fasting lipids and adiposity traits in the GWAS literature. Three of the statistically significant results for LDL-C from Table 2 were significantly associated with fasting LDL-C according to the latest published results from the Global Lipids Genetics Consortium (rs17217098, rs73004967, rs73001065 P<=3.6*10-24). Other published work in GOLDN has suggested variants that are associated with fasting lipids in large meta-analyses may be important for lipid response to fenofibrate. This region covers ~ 13 genes and ~300kb (SUGP1, TM6SF2, MAU2, GATAD2A, TSSK6, NDUFA13, YJEFN3, CILP2, PBX4, LPAR2, GMIP, ATP13A1, ZNF101) and finding a causal variant remains challenging (Figure 2). One recent study reported a nonsynonymous variant in TM6SF2 influences total cholesterol levels and is associated with myocardial infarction. The authors also reported both TM6SF2 overexpression and knockdown in mice altered serum lipid profiles. There are far fewer pharmacogenetic studies of this locus. To our knowledge, only one study examined the association of this region with LDL-C response to statin and reported no association among 895 men with dyslipidemia and 672 normolipidemic controls This locus was also not associated with LDL-C response to statin among Caucasians from the placebo arm of ACCORD (i.e. participants not treated concomitantly with fenofibrate, data not shown). A SNP (rs10401969) in this region in the cartilage intermediate layer protein 2 (CILP2) gene (located between MAU2 and PBX4) was marginally linked to LDL-C and total cholesterol fenofibrate response in a candidate gene study in GOLDN (with the smallest p-value = 0.03). Given the strength of association of variants in the region with LDL-C response this locus is promising, supporting further validation and regional sequencing efforts in search of a causal locus.

This may be due to the heterogenous effect fenofibrate has on TG lowering and HDL raising mechanisms such as increased TRL lipolysis, induction of hepatic fatty acid uptake, reduction of hepatic TG production, increased production of HDL-C precursors (Apo A-I and Apo A-II), and stimulation of reverse cholesterol transport making an effect of individual genetic factors difficult to dissect. Nonetheless, we observed at least one interesting, marginally significant peak for TG response between SNAR-I and OSTN on chromosome 3. OSTN is associated with ostioblastic differentiation, but it is also expressed in skeletal muscle and fat and has been linked to glucose and lipid metabolism. We found markers near genes linked to inflammation (TNFAIP8L3) and mitochondrial function (NDUFV2) marginally associated with HDL-C response to fenofibrate. Pathway analysis did not provide substantial further insight into our results.

Overall, GOLDN represents a healthy population and the participants were required to discontinue all lipid lowering medications prior to initiating monotherapy with fenofibrate. In contrast, the ACCORD clinical trial aimed to evaluate the additional cardioprotective effect of adding fenofibrate to baseline statin treatment among persons with type 2 diabetes, and the majority of ACCORD participants were on statin prior to starting the trial. We used statistical approaches help overcome the potential for confounding by baseline statin use (including a sensitivity analysis where ACCORD participants were treatment naive to fenofibrate but not statin at baseline) and other concomitant medication use in ACCORD. The lack of association of the top variants on chromosome 19 with LDL-C response to statin in the absence of fenofibrate in ACCORD helps support our statistical approach. Despite these notable differences the discovery populations were both Caucasian, GWAS data were imputed to the same 1000 genomes reference panel and clinically significant changes in lipids were observed after initiating fenofibrate treatment. Finally, we observed only marginal replication among Hispanics from ACCORD for index SNPs in Table 2 in or near MAU2 and PBX4. Variants listed in Table 2 did not replicate in Hispanics from the HyperTG study or African Americans from ACCORD. This may be due to small sample size in these other race groups considered. Casting a wider net for variants near (<500 kb away) our index variants (with R2>0.5 for LD) found additional markers more strongly associated with LDL-C response in ACCORD Hispanics and African Americans lending additional support for our findings and highlighting the continued need for studying ethnic groups separately to discover fenofibrate response variants (see two Supplemental Tables, Supplemental Digital Content 3 and 4).", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 31741, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Clinical data demonstrating the cardiovascular benefit of lipid lowering with the drug fenofibrate have shown mixed results.
