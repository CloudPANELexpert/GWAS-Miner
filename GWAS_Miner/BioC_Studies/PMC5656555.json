Together, these results demonstrate the utility of meta-analysis, when supplemented with the analysis of expression-level data and sequence-based data, for accelerating the discovery of functionally relevant genes involved in the etiology of ND.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 24011, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "In the present study, a novel genome-wide significant association of rs56247223 on chromosome 3 with risk for ND was identified in the African samples. SNP rs56247223 is located in an intron of CACNA2D3, and was associated with mRNA expression levels of CACNA2D3 in three human brain regions (cortex, frontal cortex, and putamen). In terms of its function, CACNA2D3 encodes a protein member of the voltage-dependent calcium channel complex. Calcium channels mediate the influx of calcium ions into cells and have an important role in neurotransmission. Calcium channels have been widely implicated in the pathophysiology of substance dependence, and they are therapeutic targets for addiction medications. Several different types of calcium channels exist, and each typically consists of four subunits, of which the CACNA2D3 gene encodes the alpha-2/delta subunit. Genomic aberrations of the genes encoding the alpha subunit of these channels have been associated with epilepsy and neuropsychiatric disorders such as autism and schizophrenia. This may be important given that smoking behavior is highly prevalent in schizophrenia patients. Of direct relevance to the present study, the voltage-dependent calcium channel complex alpha-2 and delta subunit family member gene CACNA2D1, was previously associated with risk of ND. With respect to the association of rs56247223 with ND in present study, the protective A allele of rs56247223 was associated with a decreased expression level of the gene CACNA2D3 in human brain. This finding is consistent with the observation that expression of L-type high voltage-gated calcium channel alpha2/delta subunits increases after chronic nicotine administration in mouse brain. CACNA2D3 has also been implicated with other smoking phenotypes, including a robust association with smoking cessation, in a convergent analysis of three GWA data sets. Collectively, these results support CACNA2D3 as a susceptibility gene and potential as a therapeutic target for the treatment of ND.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 26030, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Despite this evidence, it should be noted that rs56247223 was not significantly associated with ND in the European ancestry cohort.

In the UCSF Family Alcoholism study, one rare nonsynonymous variant in HAX1 was associated with an increased risk of ND, and the presence of rare variants in the HAX1 gene was found to be associated with an increased risk of ND diagnostic status. The HAX1 gene encodes a protein that often binds to several proteins, including cortactin and the product of the polycystic kidney disease 2 gene. Mutations in the HAX1 gene are responsible for autosomal recessive severe congenital neutropenia (SCN), and mutations in the HAX1 protein B isoform are associated with neuropathy in patients with SCN.

In a previous GWA study, ADAMTSL1 variants were shown to be associated with antidepressant drug response phenotype in depressed patients. Additionally, systemic administration of FG7142, an anxiogenic drug and/or a pharmacological stressor that modulates GABA receptors, leads to an increase in mRNA for ADAMTSL1 in the cortex and hippocampus of mice.

This result was partially confirmed by the finding of a rare nonsynonymous variant in GLIS3 in the UCSF Family Alcoholism study cohort that conferred a protective effect on ND. The GLIS3 gene is highly expressed in brain. SNP rs12348139 was an eQTL site for the GLIS3 gene in human brain. The GLIS3 gene encodes a member of the GLI-similar zinc finger protein family, which is a nuclear protein with five C2H2-type zinc finger domains, and is recognized as a repressor and activator of transcription. The GLIS3 gene has been identified via GWAS with two commonly used biomarkers, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) tau and tau phosphorylated at threonine 181 (ptau), for Alzheimer's disease, and also the risk of type 2 diabetes. Notably, chronic nicotine administration exacerbates tau pathology in a transgenic model of Alzheimer's disease, and cigarette smoking is correlated with a higher risk of Alzheimer's disease and type 2 diabetes. Thus, GLIS3 may have a pleiotropic effect on these three disorders that could explain, in part the pathogenesis underlying the clinical link between cigarette smoking, and Alzheimer's disease, and type 2 diabetes. We also identified SNP rs10759883 in a long non-coding RNA LINC00476 on chromosome 9 that was associated with ND. The minor risk allele C of rs10759883 was found to upregulate the expression level of LINC00476 through eQTL effects in multiple human brain regions. Although the functional relevance of LINC00476 is unclear, recent evidence suggests that non-coding RNAs play an important and dynamic role in transcriptional regulation, epigenetic signaling, stress responses, and plasticity in the nervous system.

Further, predicted expression levels of the GABBR1 gene in brain, estimated using the recently developed gene-based association method MetaXcan, were shown to be significantly associated with risk for ND. The GABBR1 gene is functionally relevant to ND. More specifically, the gene encodes a receptor for gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), which is the main inhibitory neurotransmitter in the mammalian central nervous system. Evidence in animal studies suggests that both nicotine intake and nicotine seeking are attenuated when GABA neurotransmission is facilitated. Haplotypes of the GABBR1 gene have also been identified with risk of ND in a previous study, and it has been further suggested that the GABBR1 gene contributes to the risk of ND through interactions with GABBR2.

GWAS of these ND phenotypes have been pursued in multiple independent, large-scale cohorts, but few genomic regions have been consistently and mutually validated. The differences in phenotype definition and phenotypic heterogeneity could be partly responsible for that. In the present study, we used the DSM-IV diagnosis of ND, and thus, it is not surprising that we did not observe significant overlap in association signals previously reported in the GWAS of Fagerstrom Test ND score. As noted, phenotypic heterogeneity could have also contributed to the lack of overlapping signals. The presence of co-morbid substance use disorders likely represents one such source of heterogeneity. For example, several of the contributing GWA cohorts were selected on other forms of substance use disorder (e.g., alcohol, cocaine dependence). It is likely that the etiologic factors, including genetic influences, that contribute to the development of ND in individuals with multiple substance use disorders differ, at least in part, from those factors that contribute to the development of ND in individuals with just ND. Unfortunately, data on co-occurring substance dependence diagnoses were not available across all study cohorts, and thus, could not be studied as covariates or as moderators in the association analysis.

One limitation is that several findings did not exceed the traditional genome-wide significance threshold, however, follow-up analyses such as the eQTL analysis provided some additional support for these findings. The eQTL analyses did not employ genome-wide corrections for multiple testing because they were conducted to address the specific hypothesis that variants in a candidate gene are associated with expression levels when there is prior evidence of association. The second limitation is the lack of an \"independent\" validation sample. Recent large-scale genome-wide meta-analyses have implemented broadly a two-stage study design in which they perform the initial meta-analysis, pick a set of variants to carry forward, then pursue replication attempts in sets of independent studies, and finally conduct a combined analysis of all available data. Because it has been argued that the validation effort in the meta-analysis of a two-stage design is not a true independent replication and considering the relatively small sample size in the present study, we pursued a single-stage rather than two-stage design with the aim at gathering exhaustively all available data to improve power for discovery..", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 34607, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "In summary, we carried out a large-scale GWA meta-analysis on ND, and identified seven susceptibility signals for ND.
