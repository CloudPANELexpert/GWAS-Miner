Second, the replication sample size is quite small, with an 80% power to detect an association at the 5% significance level. Although not particularly weak, there was still inadequate power to provide strong evidence for replication of small effects detected in the discovery study. We therefore included biological validation that includes in vitro cell studies. Third, due to the low frequency of the lead SNPs within the POLB-PLAT locus, we are not able to use a traditional LD mapping approach to refine the association signals. The lead SNP within POLB (rs3136739) is in perfect LD (r2=1) with the non-synonymous SNP (rs2020921) within exon 5 of PLAT, based on the HapMap2 genotype data. However, rs3136739 has a missing rate of 10% in the HapMap2 data. Even with the most recent available 1000 genomes genotype data, however, it remains difficult to fully characterize the haplotype structure for SNPs with low minor allele frequency (~5%) based on pair-wise LD. Forth, although it is impossible to rule out that the association of the non-synonymous mutation with circulating tPA levels is simply a confounder introduced by altered antibody binding during the tPA measurement procedure, it is unlikely after investigating all information available to us at this time. Finally, there may be distinct roles for genetic variation in regulating circulating levels in healthy individuals compared with elevated levels in individuals in whom thrombolytic activity is induced. While there is no evidence of heterogeneity of effect by cohort, our results cannot exclude the possibility of meaningful differences in effects of genetic variation on circulating levels in the overall population versus subgroups of individuals with increased thrombolytic activity.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 19221, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "In conclusion, by analyzing a total of 26,929 participants from 14 discovery cohorts across the United States and Europe, we provide genome-wide evidence of association of SNPs in the STXBP5, PLAT and STX2 loci with circulating levels of tPA antigen. While our analyses do not provide evidence for association of these SNPs with clinically apparent CAD or stroke, we do provide functional evidence in endothelial cells for a novel regulatory role of STXBP5 and STX2 on tPA availability. The strong eQTL result for STX2 in a wide range of tissues supports the hypothesis that associated alleles may modulate tPA levels via a functional effect on gene expression.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 19883, "infons": {"section_type": "SUPPL", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "Supplementary Material", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 19906, "infons": {"section_type": "SUPPL", "type": "footnote"}, "text": "Disclosures: No other authors have conflicts of interest to disclose.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 19976, "infons": {"section_type": "SUPPL", "type": "footnote"}, "text": "Writing Group: J.H., S.T., F.W.A., M.S-L., D.T., J.E.H., A.D.J., N.L.S., S.M.W., C.H., P.v.d.H., A.H.

In some but not all studies, elevated plasma levels of tPA have been associated with coronary artery disease (CAD) and other cardiovascular diseases. Through a genome-wide association study approach we provide evidence of association of genetic variants in the STXBP5, PLAT and STX2 loci with circulating levels of tPA antigen. While our analyses do not provide supportive evidence for association of these SNPs with clinical CAD or stroke, we do provide additional functional evidence for a novel regulatory role of STXBP5 and STX2 on tPA availability in endothelial cells. Results from gene expression studies in various tissues support the hypothesis that associated alleles may modulate circulating tPA levels via a functional effect on gene expression. Our findings provide new insights into tPA biology and avenues for future research for the prevention and treatment of thrombosis.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}], "annotations": [], "relations": []}]}
