Indeed, the mechanisms for the association of signals on chromosomes 9p21.3, 6q25.1, and 2q36.3 with coronary artery disease all require elucidation. Similarly, none of the chromosomal loci identified in the combined analysis have previously been strongly linked to coronary artery disease. However, genes in several of the loci (PSRC1 at 1p13.3, MIA3 at 1q41, and SMAD3 at 15q22.33) play a role in cell growth or inhibition. These processes are fundamental for the formation and progression of atherosclerotic plaque and also for plaque instability. Our results suggest that genetic regulation of these processes plays an important role in the development of coronary artery disease and myocardial infarction.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 21120, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Some loci from the WTCCC study that we attempted to replicate did not show association in the German study.

Nonetheless, the genotyping platform also offered an opportunity to examine genetic variants in genes with previously reported associations. Indeed, several showed evidence of an association in one of our studies. However, only SNPs in the lipoprotein lipase gene had evidence of an association in both studies. This finding is in agreement with those in most recent systematic studies that were largely unsuccessful in replicating initial findings in candidate genes. However, many of the previously studied gene variants are poorly tagged on the GeneChip array, which clearly fails to cover the full extent of even common variation in these genes.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 22328, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Whether our findings can be translated into better prevention or treatment for coronary artery disease will become clear only over time and with further research. Although the odds ratios for each locus are modest, as anticipated for a polygenic disorder, the estimates of population attributable fractions for the three validated loci are substantial, both individually and in aggregate. This observation offers the potential for improved overall coronary risk prediction. However, the case subjects in both studies had a strong family history of premature coronary artery disease, which might have enhanced the power to detect an association with coronary artery disease but also might have increased the estimated population attributable risks beyond that of sporadic cases, and further analysis of the loci in a wider range of subjects is necessary. Further studies are also needed to investigate the associations of the loci with other types of atherosclerotic disease, as well as with cardiovascular risk factors and markers. At a genetic level, studies should focus on fine mapping of the associated regions and thorough investigation of candidate genes. Our results provide a framework for all these additional studies.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 23556, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Our analysis has several important limitations.
