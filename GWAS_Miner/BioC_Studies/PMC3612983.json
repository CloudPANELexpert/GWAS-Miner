We reasoned that, with the near complete information on common variants derived from 1000 Genomes, it might be possible to pinpoint a variant, or combination of variants, that can explain all the signal of association at 15q25. We used data from 108 estimated CEU haplotypes from the April 2009 release of the 1000 Genomes Pilot 1 data.

These variants tag, or cause, the principal risk for high SQ attributable to the 15q25 locus, but the high LD makes it difficult to assign causality. The 'residual association' SNPs rs588765 and rs6495308 are in low LD with each other (R2 = 0.21), and are both only in modest LD with the principal SNPs (maximum R2 = 0.47).
