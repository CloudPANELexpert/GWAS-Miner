Furthermore, higher self-rated health has been associated with absence of chronic diseases, severe diseases, disabilities, functional limitations, and with higher physical activity, and better psychosocial wellbeing.

The study revealed moderate correlations between the different health ratings at different life stages (r = 0.33-0.61), which were predominately due to genetic factors. The finding of decreasing heritability of self-rated health with age, however, is not confirmed by cross-sectional studies, for example found a heritability of 46% in an elderly twin sample (mean age = 61 +- 8.8). As self-rated health has been shown to be for a substantial part due to genetic factors, it would be interesting to explore the genetic variants underlying this trait.

All four studies consisted of mailed-out questionnaires assessing health and lifestyle issues as well as demographic information and were approved by the QIMR Human Research Ethics Committee. Content and sampling methods of the four studies have been described in detail elsewhere. In Study 3 and 4 (more than 95% of the final sample), self-rated health was assessed with the following item: \"How would you describe your general physical health?\", rated on a 4-point Likert scale, \"excellent\" (1), \"good\" (2), \"fair\" (3), \"poor\" (4). In the other two studies the self-rated health questions were worded slightly differently: \"In general, would you say that your physical health now is excellent, good, fair or poor?\" (Study 1) and \"How would you describe your health at present? - very good, good, fair, poor, very poor\" (Study 2).

Finally, in line with previous findings, most individuals rated their health as good while few reported poor health, resulting in a skewed distribution (Table 1b).

The concept of self-rated health has also been shown to be strongly associated with mental health, e.g. someone who is depressed may rate their health status as lower than someone who is in a good state of mind. Additionally, particular personality traits may play a role in how an individual rates his or her own health, for example a person scoring high in neuroticism would most likely rate their health slightly worse than a person very low in neuroticism. All these facts indicate that self-rated health is a very broad concept on a phenotypic level and may be genetically even more complicated. We suggest that very many rare variants of small effect size may influence self-rated health and are therefore difficult to detect. The fact that our Q-Q plot (Figure 1) lifts appreciable above the 95% confidence interval also hints at the highly polygenic nature of our trait, self-rated health. A recent paper by showed that 45% of the variance of human height could be explained considering all SNPs in a study (294,831), as opposed to 5% explained by SNPs detected by the conventional GWAS approach. This indicates that even in a very clear-cut and highly heritable phenotype such as human height, variance is explained by a large number of SNPs with very small effect; too small to be detected in a normal GWAS. The International Schizophrenia Consortium showed that by using the top-half (p-value below 0.5) of the SNPs, they could quite consistently predict Schizophrenia and related disorders (e.g. Bipolar disorder) in other samples, supporting the idea of a polygenic basis to the phenotype. Another study on human height by also supports these findings: with a sample of almost 200,000 individuals they show that hundreds of genetic variants influence variance in adult height. This also shows that in order to find genes with such a small effect size a very large sample is needed. Aiming for this, a large consortium has been founded planning to conduct a meta-analysis on self-rated health in the near future, combining several samples in order to possibly confirm the regions of interest found in the present study and find additional genetic variants underlying the variation of self-rated health and possibly even predict self-rated health and related health measures/indicators across different samples as in.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 13592, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "In summary, no genome wide significant SNPs underlying self-rated health could be identified, indicating that the concept of self-rated health may be influenced by a large number of SNPs with very small effect size.
