The BAALC (brain and acute leukemia gene cytoplasmic) gene on chr. 8q22.3 is largely expressed in neural tissues and has several isoforms.

More typical is \"quantitative interaction\" where the effect of one exposure is enhanced by the presence of the second, e.g. G may have a modest effect in the absence of E but a greater effect in its presence. The converse is termed \"qualitative interaction\", where the G effects are reversed in the presence of exposure E. These are crude categories and if dose effects are strong, one could envision a transition point where extreme levels of exposure would blur the lines between categories. Power to detect statistical interaction in observational studies is determined by the true type of interaction (pure, quantitative, etc.), but more importantly by the allele frequencies at the unobserved G controlling risk and by the prevalence of exposure to the environmental risk factor E. Ignoring GxE interaction when it exists could easily lead to overlooking the role of genes influencing risk. Without confirmatory data from independent samples, it is difficult to conclude with certainty the suggestive evidence for GxE interaction seen here is important to the etiology of CP. However, replication studies will require adequate numbers of CP cases to provide sufficient statistical power to detect GxE interaction, and this study is the largest collection of CP case-parent trios reported to date.
