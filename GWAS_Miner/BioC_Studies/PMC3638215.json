The virus itself cannot be chiefly responsible for these dichotomous outcomes because they occurred even when there was accidental infection with the same HCV inoculum. Likewise, persons of African ancestry are less likely to have spontaneous resolution than persons of European or Asian backgrounds infected with the same virus genotype, strongly suggesting there is a host genetic basis.

However, prior studies have either focused on one particular SNP or had limited sample sizes from individual outcome groups and thus have restricted ability to find additional susceptibility alleles for spontaneous resolution of HCV infection.

Genetic testing can be used to predict the likelihood of spontaneous resolution of HCV infection. Guidelines for treatment of acute HCV infection recommend that interferon alpha based treatment be given if infection is not spontaneously resolved before the infection transitions to the chronic phase. This recommendation is based on the observation that those with longer HCV infection (more than 12 months) are less likely to respond to treatment than those infected for shorter periods of time. However, the precise timing of when treatment responses begin to decline is unknown and unnecessary treatment can cause significant adverse effects. IL28B testing, which is commercially available, could provide a basis for prioritizing persons with T alleles at rs12979860 for early treatment since those who have CC genotypes have a high rate of spontaneous (and treatment related) resolution.

Specifically, HCV infection itself should not provide a large competitive advantage for a human allele since it does not commonly affect human fecundity. In contrast, the virus has vast capability to evolve its own sequence to optimize its own fecundity in a particular host genetic background.
