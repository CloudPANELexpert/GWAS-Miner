Secondly, polymorphism in the region of the interleukin 28B gene (IL28B), coding for IFN-lambda(lambda)-3, has recently been identified to be strongly associated with viral clearance following pegIFN plus RBV therapy.

Whether IL28B polymorphism is relevant to other IFN-mediated effects has not been evaluated. Finally, functional variants in the inosine triphosphatase gene (ITPA) causing inosine triphosphatase (ITPase) deficiency, previously recognized as a benign red cell enzymopathy, have recently been identified to protect against RBV-induced hemolytic anemia. RBV depletes red cell GTP levels, leading in turn to ATP depletion, oxidative stress, and hemolysis.

This association was largely explained by a relative, reactive thrombocytosis in response to RBV-induced HA in those patients with wildtype ITPase activity. Thus the RBV-induced anemia attenuated the pegIFN effect to reduce Pl counts. Thrombocytosis is well-described as a consequence of hemolytic anemia, which is in keeping with the original observation in the late 1990s that on-treatment reductions of Pl counts were less marked following the addition of RBV to standard-of-care HCV therapy. This therefore represents an indirect genetic association, where wildtype ITPase activity is associated with more profound RBV-related anemia, which in turn stimulates Pl production, manifesting as less pronounced pegIFN-induced thrombocytopenia. The ITPA variants, which protect against RBV-hemolysis, are therefore associated with greater IFN-induced thrombocytopenia. The biological mechanism underlying this relationship between Hb levels and Pl counts is not clearly understood, but may involve stimulation of the bipotent erythroid/megakaryocyte progenitor cell by erythropoietin. Although adjustment for Hb reduction in the linear regression model largely attenuated the association between the ITPA variants and Pl counts, a residual association with the combined 'low activity' allele persisted (European Americans, p = 10-16 reduced to p = 10-6).

It was interesting that the hematological complications of IFN therapy were not associated with IL28B variants. Although a negative result, this has important implications for our understanding of the biology of the IL28B-pegIFN interaction. The data suggest that the biology of the IL28B-pegIFN treatment response association in HCV is not directly relevant to pegIFN-induced bone marrow suppression. IL28B polymorphism is strongly associated with on-treatment viral kinetics and pegIFN plus RBV treatment outcome. Although the mechanism by which IL28B variation effects pegIFN sensitivity remains unclear, there is evidence that levels of intrahepatic ISG expression are important and the effect is believed to primarily reflect sensitivity to exogenous IFN. The current data suggest that this is a liver-specific phenomenon. IFN-lambda is induced by similar stimuli to type 1 IFN, and shares a common downstream signaling pathway, however the expression of the IFN-lambda-receptor (IFNLR) is more restricted than that of the ubiquitous IFN-alpha-receptor (IFNABR). Although the IFNLR has been shown to be expressed by hepatocytes, IFNLR gene expression is not expressed in hematopoietic cells, with the exception of B lymphocytes. Consistent with this, minimal bone marrow suppression was observed in a recent early phase clinical trial using IFN-lambda-1 for the treatment of HCV, despite good antiviral potency.
