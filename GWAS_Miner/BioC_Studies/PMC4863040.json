To illustrate the biological relevance of this set of genes, we examined their transcript levels in a human gene expression microarray data set consisting of 12,000 genes and 126 tissue and/or cell types. pAID-associated gene expression across immune tissues or cell types (ES-I, 4.05) was notably higher than that across non-immune types (ES-NI, 2.10) on the basis of a one-tailed Wilcoxon rank-sum test (P < 1.66 x 10-10).

As the expression levels of these 'pleiotropic' genes varied diversely across immune cell types, we performed agglomerative hierarchical clustering to identify sets of genes sharing similar profiles. Genes that belonged to the same cluster (and thus shared similar expression profiles) were found to be enriched for association with specific individual or multiple autoimmune diseases (Fig. 4c). For example, cluster 1 genes, such as ICAM1, CD40, JAK2, TYK2 and IL12B, with known roles in immune effector cell activation and proliferation, were enriched for association with PSC and UC and were associated with both diseases (P < 6.82 x 10-4, one-tailed Fisher's exact test), and the expression of these genes was highest in a small subset of CD11b+ dendritic cells. These findings are consistent with the clinical observation that as many as 80% of patients diagnosed with PSC have been diagnosed with UC, and that the risk of PSC is approximately 600-fold higher in patients with UC. Cluster 2 genes included genes encoding a number of cytokines and cytokine-response factors, such as IL19, IL20, STAT5A and IL2RA, the products of which regulate effector T cell activation, differentiation and proliferation. All of these were more broadly expressed across mature natural killer (NK) cells, NK T cells and T cells, as well as neutrophils.

Although this signal was associated with JIA and CVID, a microsatellite study of PBC in a Japanese cohort localized an association signal to a 100-Kb region enclosing ADGRL2 (ref.). Nominally significant replication support at this locus was identified in the adult UC cohort from the International IBD Genetics Consortium.

The observed association with a broad range of pAIDs may be related to eQTL signals in TENM3 SNPs that correlate with serum eosinophil counts and immunoglobulin G (IgG) glycosylation rates; the latter was referenced in a study showing a pleiotropic role for IgG glycosylation-associated SNPs in autoimmune-disease risk susceptibility. The third novel association was identified near chr10p11.21 (rs7100025), mapping to TF gene ANKRD30A, which encodes an antigen recognized by CD8+ T cell clones.
