The effect of the 8q24, 2q31, 3q25 and 17q21 loci on time to all-cause mortality after EOC diagnosis was assessed using Cox regression stratified by study and modeling the per-allele effect as log-additive. Because the EOC cases showed a variable time from diagnosis to study entry, we allowed for left truncation with time at risk starting on date of diagnosis and time under observation beginning at the time of study entry. The analysis was right censored at 5 years after diagnosis in order to reduce the number of non-EOC related deaths.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 16682, "infons": {"section_type": "METHODS", "type": "title_2"}, "text": "Gene Expression Analysis in POE and OC Cell Lines", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 16732, "infons": {"section_type": "METHODS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Normal POE cell lines were established from brushings of histologically-confirmed disease-free ovaries from total hysterectomies at University College London Hospital, UK; short-term cultures were established as previously described.

RNA was extracted from POE and OC cell lines (Supplementary Table 11) using RNeasy Mini Kits (QIAgen). Reverse transcribed (RT) RNA was analysed for expression by semi-quantitative real-time PCR using the Applied Biosystems 7900HT genetic analyzer.

Expression values of all cell lines were generated relative to either the lowest or highest expression of a POE cell line, normalized against GAPDH and beta-actin. Differences in the relative expression of each candidate gene between OC and POE cell lines were assessed using a nonparametric Wilcoxon Rank sum test.

Two different types of analysis are shown: the first panel of each pair shows real time RT-PCR analysis of each gene comparing gene expression between 48 POE and 24 OC cell lines. Gene expression is shown was normalised against b-actin. Expression was also normalized against GAPDH, which gave similar results (supplementary figure 2). Error bars sow standard deviation. The second panel of each pair shows expression microarray data from an in vitro stepwise model of neoplastic transformation POE cells. Briefly, gene expression in immortalised POE (iOE) cells, verses iOEcmyc cells overexpressing CMYC, verses iOEcmyc.kras cells overexpressing CMYC and mutant KRAS. (a) BNC2 expression is significantly lower in OC cell lines verses normal POE cells for both endogenous controls. In the model of neoplastic transformation, BNC2 expression decreases significantly with each additional oncogenic event, as the cells acquire a more neoplastic phenotype. (b) TiPARP shows significantly reduced expression in OC cells compared to POE cells for both endogenous controls; TiPARP expression also decreases sequentially in the neoplastic transformation model. (c) CMYC expression is significantly increased in OC compared to POE cells for both endogenous controls and increases in the transforming cell line model. (d) Expression of HOXD3 and HOXD1 was evaluated. HOXD3 expression was too low to draw reliable conclusions. HOXD1 increased in OC compared POE cells, suggesting activation in OC development.
