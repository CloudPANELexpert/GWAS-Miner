The top plot shows the location of the plotted region on chromosome 8 with respect to cytogenetic bands. The x-axis of all subsequent plots is base-pair position, denoted along the bottom of the figure. For the main plot, the y-axis is -log10 (p value) from the GWAS. Triangles represent SNPs tested in the GWAS. Significant SNPs with an independent signal in the variance reduction analyses are labeled, have outlined triangles, and are assigned different colored shading; the colored shading is also applied to other SNPs in the region in high linkage disequilibrium (LD), where darker color indicates higher LD. The curved lines are normalized LD curves and indicate the general strength and position of LD between the labeled SNPs and other SNPs in the region. The next plot shows the density of genotyped SNPs in the region, followed by a heat map of r2 estimates between labeled SNPs and other SNPs in the region, where darker shading indicates higher LD. The next plot shows the position of established LD blocks in the 8q24.21 region. The next plot shows ENCODE histone modification binding sites with colors representing different tracks using the same color scheme as the UCSC genome browser (https://genome.ucsc.edu), and the height represents strength of the signal. The next plot shows a heat map of ENCODE DNase binding sites, with darker color representing higher sensitivity. The next plot shows a heat map of expression in a prostate cancer cell line, with darker color representing higher expression.
