Strong cis-regulation of ERAP1 expression in lymphoblastoid cell lines was seen from SNPs close to and within ERAP1, including the marker rs30187 (C allele reduced expression, P = 0.00015). In our study, we saw no difference in ERAP1 expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from ankylosing spondylitis cases compared with controls (Supplementary Table 2), suggesting that this is a less likely explanation of the mechanism of association of ERAP1 with ankylosing spondylitis.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 6888, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Three SNPs at the 2p15 locus achieved genome-wide significance in the discovery set: rs10865331 (P = 6.1 x 10-15), rs10865332 (P = 3.5 x 10-10) and rs4672503 (P = 9.3 x 10-10).

This SNP is in strong LD with the strongest ankylosing spondylitis-associated marker, rs2242944 (r2 = 0.6, D = 1). Increased expression of PSMG1 was observed in colonic biopsies from IBD cases, and it was suggested that this may be the gene involved at this locus. Ankylosing spondylitis and IBD are closely related conditions, with ~70% of those with ankylosing spondylitis having microscopic terminal ileitis resembling Crohn's disease and ~10% of those with IBD having ankylosing spondylitis.

A large recombination hotspot lying between PSMG1 and the ankylosing spondylitis-associated SNPs makes it unlikely that the association signal observed is due to effects from SNPs located in or close to PSMG1. We feel that its remoteness to the associated locus, absence of differential expression with disease, and lack of evidence of a relevant biological function make it an unlikely candidate to be directly involved in ankylosing spondylitis susceptibility. Rather, we hypothesize that the chromosome 2p15 and 21q22 regions harbor either noncoding RNA species or hitherto unreported protein-coding genes that are likely to be involved in susceptibility to ankylosing spondylitis. To investigate this further, we performed a transcriptome-wide profiling study of expressed sequence tags and small RNAs derived from PBMCs from four active ankylosing spondylitis cases and three healthy controls using Illumina's deep sequencing approach. No small regulatory RNAs such as microRNAs were seen within the regions of highly associated SNPs at either locus, although, consistent with recent findings, these were identified in association with transcription start sites of flanking genes outside the disease-associated region (Supplementary Fig. 4).

In this respect, we note that several SNPs in TNFRSF1A achieved moderate levels of association in the discovery set (strongest associated SNP, rs1800693, P = 6.9 x 10-5).
