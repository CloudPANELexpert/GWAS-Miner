Previously, we have shown the promise of using associations with blood metabolites as functional intermediate phenotypes, the so-called genetically determined metabotypes (GDMs), to understand the potential relevance of these genetic variants for biomedical and pharmaceutical research . Building on this early work, we present here the most comprehensive evaluation of genetic variance in human metabolism to date, combining genetics and metabolomics for hypothesis generation in a GWAS. We used an extensive, non-targeted and metabolome-wide panel of small molecules, analyzing >250 metabolites from 60 biochemical pathways in serum samples of 2,820 individuals from two large population-based European cohorts. We identified 37 genetic loci significant at a stringent genome-wide threshold. In contrast to most GWAS, these loci exhibited exceptionally large effect sizes of 10-60% per allele copy in 25 loci. In the majority of cases a protein biochemically related to the associated metabolic traits is encoded at these loci. As a proof of principle validation of new discoveries, we experimentally validated the predicted function of SLC16A9 as a carnitine efflux transporter. We further cross-referenced these loci with databases of disease-related and pharmaceutically-relevant genetic associations, uncovering hitherto unknown links and providing new hypotheses into the function of these loci. Finally, we made publically available a knowledge-base resource via a web-server to aid future functional studies and biological as well as clinical interpretation of GWAS findings.

Intriguingly, these three genes are functionally linked: ABO and FUT2 are involved in determining the blood group, and the ABO locus is associated with blood levels of the phosphatase ALPL . The association of ALPL with FAaP may be explained by either a genotype-dependent dephosphorylation of fibrinogen by ALPL, or a genotype-dependent change in the phosphorus pool available for FAaP. Variants in the ABO gene are associated with many different outcomes, including venous thromboembolism (VTE) . The association of ABO with FAaP, and thus modified blood coagulation properties, provides a functional explanation for the reported association of ABO with VTE risk.

We therefore tested [3H]-carnitine uptake by SLC16A9-expressing Xenopus oocytes. As shown in Figure 2, our data shows that SLC16A9 is a sodium- and pH-independent carnitine efflux transporter, possibly responsible for carnitine efflux from absorptive epithelia into the blood. Another prominent example is the highly significant association of increased urate levels and their clinical complication of gout with variants in the SLC2A9 gene , the former of which we also observe here. Although previously annotated as a glucose transporter, SLC2A9 was later shown  to encode a high-capacity urate transporter. Similar characterization experiments by specialists in the related fields shall be motivated and guided by our association data.

In all cases our associations with metabolic traits at these loci provide a possible novel biochemical basis for the genotype-dependant reaction to drug treatment, such as the association of SLCO1B1 with a series of fatty acids, including tetradecanedioate and hexadecanedioate. This information can be used to support redesign of the respective drug molecules to avoid adverse reactions. Moreover, systematic inclusion of biochemically relevant GDMs as candidate SNPs during drug trials may permit early identification of potentially adverse pharmacogenetic effects. Concretely this applies to AKR1C, which is a novel target of jasmonates in cancer cells . We reported a GDM associated with AKR1C with a large effect size on androgen metabolism.

In two cases we could establish a direct functional link, supported by both our studies, between a genetic variant, an intermediate metabolic trait, and a disease relevant endpoint: KLKB1-bradykinin-hypertension and NAT8-N-acetylornithine-eGFR. We note that by discussing only associations that are supported by two independent studies at genome-wide significance we have chosen to take a very conservative approach. Based on QQ-plots and coarse assumptions, we estimate that over 500 loci with signals of association below that conservative threshold may be confirmed as GDMs in future, more highly powered studies. On a more technical note it is worthwhile mentioning that by using a single study to metabolically profile 2,820 individuals, based on only 100 micro-liters of blood serum, we replicated in this study a wide series of findings from previous large GWAS with quantitative traits, including serum fasting glucose , bilirubin , urate , and dehydroisoandrosterone sulfate  levels.

SNPs exhibiting any of these characteristics were discarded. We applied similar exclusion criteria to each of the three dataset separately. Samples: Exclusion criteria were: (i) sample call rate <98%, (ii) heterozygosity across all SNPs >=2 s.d. from the sample mean; (iii) evidence of non-European ancestry as assessed by PCA comparison with HapMap3 populations; (iv) observed pairwise IBD probabilities suggestive of sample identity errors; (v). We corrected misclassified monozygotic and dizygotic twins based on IBD probabilities. SNPs. Exclusion criteria were (i) Hardy-Weinberg p-value<10-6, assessed in a set of unrelated samples; (ii) MAF<1%, assessed in a set of unrelated samples; (iii) SNP call rate <97% (SNPs with MAF>=5%) or < 99% (for 1% <=MAF < 5%). Alleles of all three datasets were aligned to HapMap2 or HapMap3 fwd strand alleles. Prior to merging, we performed pairwise comparison among the three datasets and further excluded SNPs and samples to avoid spurious genotyping effects, indentified as follows: (i) concordance at duplicate samples <1%; (ii) concordance at duplicate SNPs <1%; (iii) visual inspection of QQ plots for logistic regression applied to all pairwise dataset comparisons; (iv) Hardy-Weinberg p-value<10-6, assessed in a set of unrelated samples; (v) observed pairwise IBD probabilities suggestive of sample identity errors. We then merged the three datasets, keeping individuals typed at the largest number of SNPs when an individual was typed at two different arrays. The merged dataset consists of 5,654 individuals (2,040 from the HumanHap300, 3,461 from the HumanHap610Q and 153 from the HumanHap1M and 1.M arrays) and up to 874,733 SNPs depending on the dataset (HumanHap300: 303,940, HumanHap610Q: 553,487, HumanHap1M and 1.M: 874,733). Imputation was performed using the IMPUTE software package (v2)  using two reference panels, P0 (HapMap2, rel 22, combined CEU+YRI+ASN panels) and P1 (610k+, including the combined HumanHap610k and 1M reduced to 610k SNP content). 534,665 autosomal SNPs were used for the analysis of this study (basically 610K SNPs extracted from the final merged data set).", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 27751, "infons": {"section_type": "METHODS", "type": "title_2"}, "text": "3.

This was motivated by our previous observation  that the use of ratios may lead to a strong reduction in the overall trait variance. A test of normality showed that in 29,338 cases the log-transformed ratio distribution was significantly better represented by a normal distribution than when untransformed ratios were used. In 5,145 cases untransformed distribution was closer to a normal distribution. For concentrations 149 were closer to a lognormal distribution while 124 were better represented by a normal distribution. Based on this observation, and also for sake of simplicity, we decided to log-transform all metabolites and their ratios. We used the p-gain statistics  to quantify the decrease in p-value for the association with the ratio compared to the p-values of the two corresponding concentrations. A high p-gain (above 250) indicates that two metabolites are more likely to be functionally linked in a metabolic pathway that is impacted the associating genotype. KORA and TwinsUK are population-based studies. They comprise only individuals who are not displaying any severe clinical symptoms at the time of sampling. Therefore, disease state has not considered as a confounding factor in the statistical analysis. In KORA, the software PLINK (version 1.06) and SNPTEST was used with age and gender as covariates.

For ratios we required in addition that the increase in the strength of association, expressed as the change in p-value when using ratios compared to the larger of the two p-values when using two metabolite concentrations individually (p-gain), be larger than the number of tested metabolic traits (p-gain>250) . This limit is considered as a Bonferroni-type conservative cut-off for identifying those metabolite concentration pairs for which the use of ratios strongly improves the strength of association.

The 37 genetically determined metabotypes (GDMs) we reported here explain a highly relevant amount of the total variation in the studied population and therefore contribute substantially to the genetic part of human metabolic individuality. GDMs are presented here color-coded (a) by general metabolic pathways together with selected associated metabolic traits, highlighting the relationship between gene function and the associated metabolic trait (see column 4 in Table 1), and (b) by overlap with associations in previous GWAS with disease [red], intermediate disease risk factors [yellow], and other traits [green]. Locus overlap is defined here by the lead SNP reported in the NHGRI GWAS catalogue being highly correlated (R2>=0.8) with the most associated SNP in the metabolomics scan (see column 5 in Table 1 and Suppl. Table 7). Note that the overlap between the metabolomics loci and the loci reported by the NHGRI GWAS catalogue is highly significant when compared to a draw of 37 randomly selected SNPs with similar properties (p<3x10-6, see Methods).", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 44760, "infons": {"file": "emss-54209-f0002.jpg", "id": "F2", "section_type": "FIG", "type": "fig_title_caption"}, "text": "Experimental evidence for SLC16A9 (MCT9) as a carnitine efflux transporter", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 44835, "infons": {"file": "emss-54209-f0002.jpg", "id": "F2", "section_type": "FIG", "type": "fig_caption"}, "text": "When incubated in uptake medium containing [3H]-carnitine (4muCi/ml) there was no significant uptake indicating that MCT9 does not mediate carnitine uptake. As some of the previously characterised MCTs are proton-coupled , uptake was measured at both pHout 7.4 and 5.5, but no significant difference was observed (data not shown). However, when 4.6nl of [3H]-carnitine was injected into the oocyte followed by incubation in medium for 90 minutes, efflux was significantly higher in oocytes expressing MCT9 than in the non-injected (NI, Figure a) or water-injected (WI, Figure b) controls, while again changing the pHout had no effect (Figure a). In agreement with the lack of uptake of [3H]-carnitine, external unlabelled carnitine was unable to trans-stimulate [3H]-carnitine efflux with no significant difference in efflux between MCT9-expressing oocytes in the absence or presence of 5mM carnitine (MCT9 vs. MCT9+carn, respectively, Figure b). Data are means +- SEM of 6-10 oocytes per data point from 2 oocyte preparations. Y-axis on plots represents remaining [3H]-Carnitine (cpm/oocytes). Statistical significance was determined by the Student's t test. Taken together, these results are consistent with MCT9 acting as a unidirectional carnitine efflux system when expressed in Xenopus oocytes. Note that additional experiments are required to establish the full substrate specificity of MCT9. If future studies show an appropriate cellular distribution, MCT9 could be responsible for carnitine efflux across the basolateral membrane of absorptive epithelial cells following absorption via the well-characterized apical epithelial proton-coupled carnitine transporters OCTNs / SLC22 family .", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 46535, "infons": {"file": "T1.xml", "id": "T1", "section_type": "TABLE", "type": "table_title_caption"}, "text": "37 loci that displayed genome-wide significance in the meta-analysis", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 46604, "infons": {"file": "T1.xml", "id": "T1", "section_type": "TABLE", "type": "table_caption"}, "text": "The metabolic trait with the strongest association at the discovery stage in both studies is reported together with the SNP identifier and the p-value of association from the meta-analysis.
