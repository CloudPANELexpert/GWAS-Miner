Although BMI is generally a good indicator of adiposity and disease risk, it does not allow distinguishing between lean and fat body mass. Using body fat percentage, a more accurate measure of body composition, may identify new loci more directly associated with adiposity.

Leptin and adiponectin are two hormones (adipokines) produced exclusively in adipose tissue, which respond in a reciprocal manner to changes in fat mass and insulin resistance. Higher levels of leptin and lower levels of adiponectin correlate with increased body fat and insulin resistance. Leptin data was available for 4,641 individuals and adiponectin data for 9,769 individuals participating in our stage 2 meta-analysis (Online Methods, Supplementary Figure 1). Interestingly, the body fat percentage decreasing allele was associated with lower adiponectin levels in men (P=6.1x10-6, n=8,681), which is in contrast to what we expected given the inverse correlation between body fat percentage and adiponectin levels. No association with lower adiponectin levels was observed in women (n=1,088), which was significantly different from the association in men (Psex-difference=0.040) (Figure 3, Supplementary Table 6). The association between the locus near IRS1 and leptin levels was not significant, which could be due to low statistical power as the size of the sample available was small (Figure 3, Supplementary Table 6). Intriguingly, recent studies in leptin-deficient (ob/ob) mice have demonstrated that transgenic overexpression of adiponectin permits metabolically healthy expansion of subcutaneous adipose tissue, preventing accumulation of lipids in liver and retaining insulin sensitivity. Vice versa, we speculate that the lower adiponectin levels, seen in men with the fat percentage decreasing allele of the near-IRS1 locus, might be associated with the lack of ability to expand subcutaneous adipose tissue, leading to a flux of lipids into liver and increased insulin resistance through a lipotoxic mechanism.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 12893, "infons": {"section_type": "RESULTS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "To examine whether the rs2943650 SNP modifies the function of the IRS1 gene, we studied gene expression profiles within subcutaneous adipose tissue and blood from 604 Icelandic individuals (the deCODE cohort), within liver (n=567), subcutaneous (n=610) and omental (n=742) adipose tissue from patients who underwent bariatric surgery, and within normal cortical brain samples of 193 individuals of European descent (Online Methods).

However, the mechanisms linking the locus near IRS1 with type 2 diabetes may be more complex than previously thought. Our data suggest that genetic variation near IRS1 may be associated with a reduced ability to store subcutaneous fat, at least in men, which may partly explain the association with whole-body insulin resistance and dyslipidemia. Adipose tissue insulin sensitivity itself has little impact on whole body insulin sensitivity, which is largely determined by the liver and muscle. However, impaired ability of subcutaneous adipose tissue to expand may disrupt insulin signaling in liver and muscle by leading to ectopic deposition of lipids.

Men tend to deposit less subcutaneous and more visceral fat than women, and IRS-1 may thus have a stronger role in the regulation of subcutaneous fat in men. The association of the near-IRS1 locus with the expression of IRS1 in subcutaneous adipose tissue was more pronounced in men, indicating that there may be sex differences in the effects of the near-IRS1 locus on gene function itself.
