CBLN2 has been previously reported to be mainly expressed in different regions of the brain , but because CBLN2 is in close proximity to the associated SNPs, we aimed to determine CBLN2 expression in the lung and other cell types. We found that CBLN2 mRNA is expressed in the whole lung and at lower levels in circulating cells, such as lymphocytes. CBLN2 mRNA levels were significantly higher in lungs explanted from PAH patients than from histologically normal lung tissue derived from subjects undergoing surgery for lung cancer (control lungs) (Figure 1). CBLN2 was detected in endothelial, epithelial and in circulating cells from patient and control lung samples via immunohistochemistry, but the levels of expression varied widely from sample to sample (Figure 2). In cultured pulmonary vascular cells, we found that CBLN2 mRNA was expressed in endothelial cells (EC) isolated from pulmonary artery (PA-EC), in contrast with pulmonary artery vascular smooth muscle cells (PA-SMC) where expression was detected at very low levels (Figure 3). The CBLN2 expression levels in primary cultured EC explanted from PAH lung samples collected during lung transplantation were higher than in EC from control lung samples (Figure 3). We hypothesized that CBLN2 synthesized by the EC might act on vascular SMC proliferation in a paracrine fashion. Therefore we treated serum-deprived PA-SMC in primary cultures with the CBLN2 peptide at concentrations ranging from 0.01 to 10 nM. A significant log-linear trend to proliferation inhibition was observed in cultured PA-SMC with increasing concentrations of CBLN2 (Figure 4).
