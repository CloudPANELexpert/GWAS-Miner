Consequently, diminished activities of PON-1 and other paraoxonases have been associated with the development of CVD.

After adjusting for Framingham risk factors, eCrCl, diabetes mellitus and log-transformed hsCRP, lower serum arylesterase activity (HR 2.20 [95%CI 1.60-3.02], p<0. 01) and to a lesser extent lower serum paraoxonase activity (HR 1.39 [95%CI 1.04-1.85], p<0.05) demonstrated increased risk in developing future MACE. Even when cTnI levels were added to the model (within the \"normal\" range of 0.001-0.029 mg/dL), lower serum arylesterase levels still maintain a 2-fold increased risk in MACE at 3 years (HR 2.04 [95%CI 1.49-2.79], p<0.01).

The prognostic value of serum arylesterase activity was observed within the secondary prevention cohort (Table 2), as well as within subjects who demonstrated a recent \"normal catheterization\" (i.e., no significant (>50%) angiographic evidence of CAD in any major vessel or preceding history of CAD - the primary prevention cohort, Table 2). Serum arylesterase activity also remained a prognostic indicator within each Framingham risk factor sub-cohort and among those with low hsCRP (Figure 2), or in those without statin therapy (n=1,512). In addition to serum arylesterase remaining a significant predictor of MACE after addition of higher sensitivity troponin testing to traditional risk factors and laboratory risk markers in the models, we further observed an increased risk of developing subclinical myocardial necrosis (troponin levels that are detectable but remain below the 99th percentile diagnostic cutoff among healthy subjects used to define cutoff for MI) with decreasing quartiles of serum arylesterase levels (odds ratio 2.01 [95%CI 1.53-2.64], p<0.001, Figure 3) - this trend was not observed with serum paraoxonase activity levels (Figure 3).", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 15001, "infons": {"section_type": "RESULTS", "type": "title_2"}, "text": "GWAS for PON-1 activities", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 15027, "infons": {"section_type": "RESULTS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "We next performed a GWAS for serum paraoxonase and arylesterase activity in 2,136 GeneBank subjects (all of Caucasian ancestry) for whom both genotype and PON-1 functional data were available. The genomic inflation factors for paraoxonase and arylesterase activity were 1.015 and 1.013, respectively, indicating that the GWAS results were not confounded by underlying population stratification, and the Q-Q plots are shown in Supplemental Figure 1. Serum paraoxonase activity was controlled by a major locus on chromosome 7 containing the PON-1, PON-2, and PON-3 genes (Figure 4A). The lead SNP for serum paraoxonase activity at this locus (rs2057681) is located within the PON-1 gene and yielded a highly significant p-value of 1.18 x 10-303 (Figure 4A, Table 3). Based on our genotype data, rs2057681 is in near complete linkage disequilibrium (LD) (r2=0.99) with a functional amino acid substitution in PON-1 (rs662; Q192R), which is also associated with increased paraoxonase activity (p=3.31 x 10-295; Table 3). Of interest, while rs2057681 and rs662 are associated with significant increase in paraoxonase activity, they are also associated with significant decrease in arylesterase activity (Table 3). Another known coding SNP in PON-1 (rs854560; L55M) exhibited significant association with paraoxonase activity as well (p=1.27 x 10-140; Table 3) but is in relatively weak LD (r2=0.20) with the aforementioned lead SNPs (rs2057681 and rs662). The GWAS analysis for serum arylesterase activity also revealed that this chromosome 7 region was the major locus controlling this measure of PON-1 functional activity (Figure 4B). For example, the lead SNP for serum arylesterase activity, rs854572, is located in the promoter region of PON-1 and yielded a highly significant p value of p=4.99 x 10-116 (Table 3). This SNP (rs854572) also was associated with increase in paraoxonase activity. Of note, the four lead SNPs for arylesterase activity differ from those identified for paraoxonase activity, although they do exhibit some association with paraoxonase activity and vice versa (Table 3). However, the lead SNPs for arylesterase and paraoxonase activity are in weak LD (r2<0.23), suggesting that the reciprocal associations are for the most part independent. Further, the lead SNPs for both paraoxonase (rs2057681) and arylesterase (rs854572) activities are localized in the PON-1 gene and not in LD with variants in either PON-2 or PON-3 genes. We next determined whether the lead SNPs on chromosome 7 influenced other CAD risk factors but did not observe any significant evidence for such associations (Supplemental Table 1). Since BMI and statin use have been shown to potentially affect serum paraoxonase activity, we also adjusted the genetic analyses for these potential confounders. However, the strength of the association of the lead SNPs with paraoxonase and arylesterase activities was not diminished when either BMI or statin use alone was included with age and gender in the genetic models or in a fully adjusted model that included all four covariates (Supplemental Table 2).

To gain further insight into the effect of the chromosome 7 variants on PON-1 function, we also examined the relationship between serum paraoxonase and arylesterase activities in our cohort. As illustrated in Figure 5, both activities were significantly correlated overall (r=0.30, p<0.001) and exhibited a striking grouping of 3 distinct patterns when plotted against each other. These three clusters were found to correspond nearly exactly with the three genotype groups of the Q192R (rs662) polymorphism (Figure 5A), with 97.2% with genotype QQ in the top cluster, 97.2% with genotype QR in the middle cluster, and 91.3% with genotype RR in the bottom cluster.

Its catalytic activity within crude serum mixtures has traditionally been measured by quantifying enzymatic hydrolysis rates of two known in vitro substrates, with functional activities named paraoxonase and arylesterase activities. There are several novel findings in this report that describe the clinical and genetic associations of PON-1 activities with cardiovascular risks that differ from prior observations from smaller cohorts. First, we demonstrated prognostic value of serum arylesterase activity (and to a lesser extent serum paraoxonase activity) in predicting long-term cardiovascular risk in a wide range of subjects already treated with contemporary medical therapy. We observed that diminished serum arylesterase activity, particularly within the lowest quartile range, was predictive of adverse long-term cardiac events independent of standard clinical and biochemical risk factors, and provided incremental value in reclassifying subjects who are at higher risk of long-term MACE. Furthermore, the prognostic value of serum arylesterase activity was evident in both primary as well as secondary prevention subjects. The fact that arylesterase activity provided prognostic value consistently within subjects with or without underlying angiographic evidence of significant CAD implies that a lack of systemic anti-oxidant defense mechanisms (a primary function of PON-1) may both promote greater vulnerability to oxidative stress, as well as increase risk for development and progression of CAD in subjects. Moreover, the ability of low serum arylesterase activity to identify those at significant increased risk of MACE, even among primary prevention subjects with recent coronary angiographic data showing < 50% stenosis in all major coronary vessels, suggests this assay has prognostic value, and can identify a vulnerable cohort of subjects who otherwise are not identified as being at high risk.

This is supported by the GWAS analyses conditioned on the lead SNPs, which did not identify other genomic regions associated with either paraoxonase or arylesterase activity. Furthermore, the lead SNPs for either enzymatic activity localize to the PON-1 gene, are distinct from each other, and are not in LD with SNPs in the neighboring PON-3 and PON-2 genes. However, while the PON-1 variants exhibited strong (if not opposed) effects on PON function, they were not associated with future risk of MACE, either individually or as a haplotype that modestly decreased both paraoxonase and arylesterase activity. These results are consistent with our analyses from the CARDIoGRAM consortium, which did not reveal an association of these SNPs with either prevalent CAD or history of MI in ~80,000 subjects. It should be noted, however, that since the lead SNPs only contributed to an estimated ~15% of PON-1 activity variation, other processes, such as post-translational modifications, could also play a role in determining the ultimate functionality of PON-1. For example, PON1 is known to be sensitive to post-translational oxidative modification and inactivation. It is also possible that our study was underpowered to detect genetic effects on prospective risk of MACE since only 311 subjects out of the ~2,700 subjects included in these analyses experienced a MACE over three years of follow up.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 26764, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The lack of associations between the lead SNPs for PON and arylesterase activities with CAD and MI risks in humans in our study are in direct contrast to what has been observed in mice where PON-1 deficiency leads to increased aortic lesion formation, and transgenic mice over expressing PON-1 are protected . It is of interest that the PON-1 transgenic mouse models demonstrating protective effects have 50-400% increased serum arylesterase activity , far in excess of the modest changes in activity associated with the peak SNP identified in the arylesterase GWAS. If arylesterase activity is the more important atheroprotective aspect of PON-1 function, as our clinical associations with MACE suggest, then it may not be surprising that an association was not observed with the SNPs identified. For example, the lead SNP for arylesterase activity (rs854572) only increases activity by ~16% per minor allele copy. It is thus possible that the genetic effects on arylesterase activity from this SNP are too weak to observe, especially if a minimum biological threshold of activity change is needed to influence risk of prevalent CAD, history of MI, or incident risk of MACE.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 27942, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The ability for serum arylesterase activity to identify a high-risk population in the primary prevention cohort that just underwent cardiac catheterization and showed no significant evidence of stenoses in any major vessel may have important clinical implications. Even though our subset analysis was limited by the relatively smaller sample size and low event rates, a significant 4-fold increase risk in long-term MACE in these otherwise \"low risk\" subjects was identified. Use of serum arylesterase activity may thus have clinical utility, and help identify an important patient cohort that may warrant more aggressive risk factor reduction treatment strategies who might otherwise not be targeted for aggressive preventive intervention. In addition to low serum arylesterase activity predicting increased risk for MACE in primary prevention subjects, there was a direct association also noted between lower serum arylesterase activity level and increased prevalence of significantly obstructive CAD by angiography. Of note, we did not find a strong relationship between systemic inflammatory biomarkers, such as C-reactive protein or leukocyte parameters, with serum arylesterase levels in this group of stable cardiac patients.

Serum paraoxonase and arylesterase activities utilized substrates that are not the endogenous substrates for PON-1, but are used because they are not readily influenced by other esterases/lactonases in serum, and are presumed to reflect the underlying catalytic activity of PON-1. The GWAS results observed demonstrate these assumptions are reasonable, as only genetic variations in the PON-1 gene were observed to be associated with variations in paraoxonase and arylesterase activities. A further potential limitation is that the measurements were only made under fasting conditions at a single time-point. Hence, we are unable to determine the variability and prognostic value of level changes over time and the impact of dietary or therapeutic interventions on serum arylesterase activity level. Selection bias may also be present for those undergoing cardiac catheterization for symptomatic evaluation and management of cardiac diseases at a tertiary care setting, but the large sample size and event rates of the patient population, together with careful phenotypic evaluation including angiographic data, provides unique insights and adequate power to adjust for clinical and biomarker variables.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 30553, "infons": {"section_type": "CONCL", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "CONCLUSIONS", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 30565, "infons": {"section_type": "CONCL", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Diminished serum arylesterase activity can provide incremental prognostic value and clinical reclassification of stable patients at risk of developing MACE, even amongst primary prevention subjects who just demonstrated no significant coronary stenoses by angiography and might otherwise be dismissed as low risk.
