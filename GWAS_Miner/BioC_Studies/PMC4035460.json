A similar conclusion could be reached for SNPs in zone 7 of this panel in which the SNP would have an effect (albeit negative) for those with a college degree but not for those without a degree. Zones 4 and 5 are those in which the effect of the SNP is very large for non-college graduates but much smaller for college graduates. In this case, the distribution of effects is in line with the diathesis-stress model. For example, there is one observed SNP that increases BMI by roughly six units for each risk allele among those without a college degree but is unrelated to BMI for those with a college degree. Figure 4 illustrates the difficulty in testing the diathesis-stress (zones 4 and 5) vis-a-vis the social push (zones 2 and 7) model. There is evidence for both of the models, they seem to be equally likely, and the distribution of the effects does not appear to be different from a random environment. Consider the 349 interesting SNPs (those with p values less than 10-3) for the college graduates (the upper-left quadrant of the figures on the right). Among these SNPs, 316 did not reach p < .10 for the non-college group, suggesting that roughly 90 % of the SNPs that predict BMI for college graduates are not associated with BMI among non-college graduates. This might seem to provide strong support for the social push perspective. However, 87 % of the SNPs that predict BMI for non-college graduates (n = 258) are roughly equal to zero for college graduates, and very similar results are shown for the simulated environment (90 % and 94 %, respectively). Again, the difference is very slight, with no clear evidence that these are different from a random environment. In other words, although some SNPs fall within zones 2, 4, 5, and 7, their presence does not necessarily provide support for the diathesis-stress or the social push perspectives. It is possible that the environment is systematically causing SNPs to operate differently across the environments, but differentiating real GxE signals from those due to chance is difficult to achieve using traditional methods and existing data sources.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 31623, "infons": {"section_type": "RESULTS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Finally, it is quite clear that the effect sizes required for deeming SNPs statistically significant are somewhat unrealistic.

For a 140-pound adult who is 5'8'', this increase translates to an increase in of more than 26 pounds. This assumes an additive model and doesn't take into account the minor allele frequency, but it illustrates the rather extreme substantive implications if our understanding of genetic influences on BMI is based on SNPs that are deemed to be statistically significant from GWAS models. The same (albeit more extreme) understanding can be seen for the SNPs in the upper-left corner of Fig. 4 that have slopes that are near or exceed 10; a 20-BMI increase comparing the two homozygous groups at one loci is simply not possible.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 32531, "infons": {"section_type": "RESULTS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Rather than trying to identify specific causal loci, the heritability-by-environment approach attempts to identify systematic differences in the genetic contribution to overall variance. As noted earlier, these models traditionally relied on twins and siblings to estimate the contribution of assumed genetic similarity to their observed phenotypic similarities. However, genome-wide data can also provide comparable estimates by comparing observed genetic similarity with observed phenotypic similarity of unrelated persons. The first column of Table 2 presents the genetic (Vg), environmental (Ve), and total phenotypic variance (Vp) for BMI among the third-generation participants of the FHS. The ratio of genetic variance to total variance provides an estimate of heritability. Estimated heritability of BMI is .52 and .60 for those without and with a college degree, respectively. This model is in line with the social push GxE model because the genetic factors are relatively more important for those in a relatively healthy environment. That is, the difference in heritability across the groups is due to differences in environmental variation rather than differences in the genetic effects. This can be seen in the components of the model where the genetic variance is virtually identical for the two groups (16.32 vs. 16.24), but there is more environmental variation among those with less than a college education than among college graduates (14.84 vs. 10.86). Comparable results are shown in the work of, who used a large study of twins from the Danish Twin Registry (~20,000 twin pairs) to calculate genetic and environmental contributions to BMI; increasing levels of education are associated with increasing heritability of BMI, but this is because there is less overall phenotypic variance among the most-educated.

The heritability estimate for the full sample is the sum of the genetic and GxE components, and it allows one to consider the contribution of GxE to overall heritability. In this case, 28 % of the additive genetic influences (.28 = 4.50 / (4.50 + 11.69)) on BMI are due to GxE processes. Finally, as with the GWGEI models, we also estimated a comparable GCTA GxE model in which we randomly assigned environmental status, and the model produced a heritability of .52 and a GxE estimate of 0 (SE = 2.22). These results do not necessarily imply that the environment causes genes to operate differently; rather, it simply changes the relative importance of genes vis-a-vis the environment. However, the lack of significance of the GxE component with the simulated environment compared with the value from the empirical environment provides some tentative evidence for the social push GxE perspective and highlights the importance of considering environmental context when examining genetic contributions to complex phenotypes like BMI.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 35785, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "Discussion", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 35796, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Gene-environment interactions for obesity-related phenotypes have been shown in candidate gene and twin and sibling studies.

Our primary goal was to situate the GWGEI findings within the existing GxE theoretical framework to provide some structure as we sifted through hundreds of thousands of main environmental, main genetic, and GxE terms. Our results suggest that the search for specific alleles that are related to health outcomes of interest to demographers, such as physical weight, may not provide useful information, and the results from GWGEI analyses are also not likely to shed any light on the existing GxE typology, especially given sample sizes in the thousands. Even with a well-established environmental factor and a highly heritable phenotype, we cannot detect overall patterns that consistently support one of the existing models vis-a-vis the others. We were able to find some evidence for each GxE model but no consistent story with biologically plausible mechanisms linking environmental sensitivity to BMI and differentiating the pattern of results from noise. This point is important because it is likely that many of the GxE associations are real, but we simply could not differentiate between real and false interactions with our current methods and data. A SNP-based approach is unlikely to provide empirical results that can be used to support the existing GxE models.

As our methods section explains, genome-wide data provide exceptional detail on the genetic similarity of unrelated persons in our studies. These data are already available from a number of population data sources that also contain indicators of mobility, migration, mortality, marriage, birth outcomes, health, and health behaviors. If genes are associated with environmental exposure and the health outcome of interest (e.g., genes linked to novelty-seeking behaviors may predict selection into a social group of smokers and may also predict smoking behavior), then researchers may reach erroneous conclusions about the role of environmental factors. By creatively using these data to account for genetic factors that predict the independent and dependent variables, demographers can rule out alternative explanations. extended the GCTA model to include an estimate of genetic correlation using a bivariate approach.

We are skeptical that any one SNP will hold sufficient information to shed light on individual differences in environmental sensitivity, but summary information across a number of different loci may prove to be useful. For example, examined 29 SNPs that have been linked to body mass phenotypes from published GWAS studies. They summed the number of risk alleles for these 29 SNPs from an independent sample to form a genetic risk score (GRS). BMI was then regressed on the GRS, and they were able to explain roughly 2 % of the variance of BMI in their study. This is a very useful approach that uses existing genome-wide data sources without performing a GWAS, per se.

It is possible that one or both of these factors account for our inability to detect associations at genome-wide significance levels. To examine this possibility, we reestimated the same GWGEI models presented in Fig. 2 without the adjustment for parental mating type (population stratification) or the interaction between parental mating type and college degree status (gene-environment correlation). These results are summarized in two diagrams in Fig. 5. The left panel plots the bivariate association between the p value (-log10) from the fully adjusted GWGEI model (those from Fig. 2) and the p values from the GWGEI models without controls for population stratification or gene-environment correlation. If these controls did not affect the p values for the two models, we would expect to see a clear linear association between the values: this is clearly not the case. In fact, the bivariate correlation between the two logged p values is only .30. The right panel is the QQ plot for the unadjusted GWGEI model. There is a notable improvement in the departure of the values from the uniform line when compared with the comparable estimates in Fig. 2, but we still do not have any SNPs that cross the genome-wide significance level, so our failure to detect true GxE SNPs in our GWGEI model is not due to overadjustment of our models. Similarly, even when the analyses are conducted with the same individuals in the full sample, the parameter estimates show tremendous variation between the two models. We do find some associations that approach genome-wide significance, but these drop precipitously with important adjustments for stratification and rGE, and some show suppressor effects so that the unadjusted estimates have p values of less than .001 but the adjusted estimates are less than .00001. In other words, the effects of each SNP are very small and are quite sensitive to the inclusion or exclusion of control variables, which may have to do with our fairly small sample size. For instance, stated that studies expecting to achieve genome-wide significance levels of p < 5 10-8 need to exceed 50,000 individuals.

This question is critical to both social and genetic epidemiologists because it suggests that environmental influences depend on an individual's genetic composition and that genetic influences are contingent on the social environment in which one resides, works, and plays. Little debate exists about the relevance of this question, but finding an answer has thus far proven to be quite difficult. There is little consensus on what constitutes the environment, little agreement regarding statistical versus substantive significance of interactions, little consensus about social and genetic theories explaining the mechanisms of gene-environment interplay, and a replication record that is only marginally better than chance. Our results suggest that these concerns may be more important when extended to the genome-wide scale. Our results do not challenge the relevance of GWAS studies, nor do they challenge GxE studies in general. Rather, we believe that the SNP-by-SNP GxE approach (GWGEI) is not likely to provide results that can be used to test existing GxE theory. In sum, we believe that SNPs indicate something important about an individual's risk of an unhealthy BMI, but taken individually, they do not hold much information. This is somewhat obvious: people do not inherit a single SNP. Rather, they inherit their entire genome from two sources:hence the importance of genome-wide data as a cumulative indicator of biological proximity among related and unrelated persons.
