Perhaps most interestingly, if this relationship is indeed confirmed by ongoing functional studies of MTRR, this genetic relationship would be an example of a GWAS approach identifying a de facto \"candidate gene\" that has been largely previously ignored by classic candidate gene methods.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 22521, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Separately, while a number of our other top meta-analysis SNPs are interesting for possible functional and clinical importance, the identification of SNP rs11722476 (a missense SNP within SMARCAD1) was especially intriguing. First, there were a noticeably large (and disproportionate) number of repetitive, strong signals within SMARCAD1 among our top 321 meta-analysis SNPs (see Fig. 7A), and two signals within SMARCAD1 (potentially in linkage disequilibrium [LD]) among the most significant (P<10-5) overall SNPs (Table 1). These findings, along with the identification of the above missense SNP in this region, compositely suggest importance of this gene for capecitabine. SMARCAD1, a member of a helicase superfamily including proteins essential to genome replication, repair, and expression, has interestingly been previously mentioned (although only tangentially) in reports that would be consistent with a 5-FU-related importance. One study, using deletion mapping of chromosome 4q22-35, showed that SMARCAD1 was frequently deleted in head and neck cancers, which are often treated successfully by 5-FU. This might imply that SMARCAD1 gene dosage effects could potentially underlie one mechanism of 5-FU susceptibility for these tumors. A second unrelated study found (via expression analysis) that SMARCAD1 has particularly high levels in endocrine tissues. Breast tissue would be considered highly endocrine-responsive (estrogen/progesterone receptors) and therefore, while still speculative, this could begin to suggest a role for SMARCAD1 polymorphism in explaining the sensitivity of breast cancers to capecitabine. Of course, such hypotheses would need to be confirmed by formal molecular studies, highlighting the fact that GWA studies are often excellent for permitting new hypothesis generation.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 24338, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "None of the typically-studied capecitabine/5-FU pathway candidate genes themselves (TYMS, TYMP, MTHFR, DPYD, among others) were identified among the top SNP signals in our study. This could be due, in part, to tissue-restricted down regulation of some of these genes in LCLs. However, it also illustrates the idea that a combined approach (genome-wide plus candidate gene methods) may ultimately yield the most comprehensive approach to drug susceptibility pharmacogenomics, perhaps especially in oncology. Additionally, there may be differences in the pharmacogenomics of capecitabine compared to 5-FU (just as there are differences in the toxicity profiles for these two drugs), and there has been relatively much less clinical investigation into the pharmacogenomics of capecitabine. One recent study implicated a role for TYMS in patients with colon cancer receiving a regimen containing capecitabine. A second prior study had also previously found the strongest evidence for TYMS among the typically-studied capecitabine candidate genes.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 25381, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Our study has recognized limitations. While SNP rs4702484 did achieve genome-wide statistical significance in the CEU-only GWAS, none of the meta-analysis results achieved P values below the generally-accepted GWA cutoff of ~5x10-8 . In this sense, the overall statistical power gained by combining six panels in the meta-analysis was probably less than we expected. This may be due to different underlying LD structures between the individual populations. At the same time, it has been argued that additional factors in the comprehensive evaluation of GWAS findings need to be considered beyond just the P value threshold, and we would suggest that SNPs in our meta-analysis with P values of ~10-6 or smaller:especially when the association directionality is consistent across all 6 individually-tested panels:have a higher likelihood of true importance. The fact that 4 SNPs indeed achieved P values of ~10-7 (approaching traditional genome-wide significance) despite our sample size (~500 individuals) which would typically be considered too small for conducting a GWAS may emphasize the potential relevance of these findings. We believe it also simultaneously validates the utility of the meta-analysis approach. Secondly, the majority of the top identified SNPs are located in regions of the genome without obvious apparent functional explanation. This could reflect two possibilities: either this simply reflects the greater statistical probability of more commonly identifying variants in non-coding regions of the genome since those regions inherently comprise a vastly greater total percentage of the genome; or this signals the novelty and the advantage of GWAS studies like this one for interrogating chemotherapeutic pharmacogenomic traits, where an unbiased approach may be exactly what is desired, since candidate-gene or single-gene methods have often fallen short. Thirdly, although the genetic information in this study is from human individuals in the HapMap project, and although meta-analysis approaches when conducted properly may obviate the need for additional replication in a separate population, the phenotypes were derived in a cell-line model and therefore the results require validation in clinical populations of patients taking capecitabine.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 27665, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "It should lastly be mentioned that while our cross-population method offers the advantage of identifying relatively common SNPs testable in all or most individuals regardless of ethnic background, we did find allelic heterogeneity among the top SNPs (and often one or more populations were monomorphic at a given identified locus) and, despite the value of a cross population meta-analysis, one of our strongest results was found via a single-population analysis, underscoring the value of individual population analyses as well.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 28195, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "In summary, we conducted a large, cell-based meta-analysis of genome-wide association findings for capecitabine chemotherapy susceptibility across multiple divergent human populations.
