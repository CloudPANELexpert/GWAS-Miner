It has been shown that genetic variants that increase risk for AD modify CSF Abeta42 and tau levels, including pathogenic mutations in APP, PSEN1 and PSEN2, and the common variants in APOE. CSF ptau levels correlate with the number of neurofibrillary tangles and the load of hyperphosphorylated tau present in the brain. Elevated CSF ptau levels are correlated with neuronal loss and predict cognitive decline and conversion to AD in subjects with mild cognitive impairment. Enigmatically, CSF tau levels are normal or low in other tauopathies such as progressive supranuclear palsy, so the precise relationship between the burden of tau pathology as well as the extent of neurodegeneration and the levels of CSF tau remain to be fully clarified. This notwithstanding, CSF tau levels may be a useful marker to identify genetic variants implicated not only with risk for Alzheimer's disease but also age at onset or rate of progression.

To determine whether APOE SNPs influence CSF tau and ptau levels independently of Abeta pathology, and disease status we performed analyses including CSF Abeta42 levels, or CDR as covariates in a regression model.

Second, each of the genome-wide significant loci is the result of a strong and consistent association in each dataset. This is especially important, because a priori, the absolute values for the CSF biomarker traits are significantly different between series, which could lead to the identification of false positives.

APOE is a known genetic risk factor for AD and most functional studies have focused on Abeta-dependent mechanisms. To determine whether or not the association of APOE SNPs with CSF tau and ptau levels was dependent of Abeta pathology we performed analyses including CSF Abeta42 levels as a covariate. We also stratified our samples by case control status and by low or high CSF Abeta42 levels. In all of these analyses we found that the association between APOE SNPs and tau or ptau levels remained significant (table 4 and S2), suggesting that APOE may also affect tau pathology via an Abeta-independent mechanism. Several other studies support this hypothesis. APOE shows isoform specific differences in its interaction with tau in vitro and in transgenic mice neuron-specific differences in APOE isoform proteolysis are associated with increased tau phosphorylation and pathology. These data provide additional evidence that APOE could also influence risk for AD through a tau-dependent mechanism, independent of effects on Abeta. When APOE genotype was included as a covariate, some SNPs in the APOE locus showed a moderate association with CSF tau/ptau levels (rs769449; P=9.07x10-03), indicating that most of the association is driven by APOE genotype, but suggesting that there may be additional variants in this region that modify CSF tau levels and risk for AD, independently of APOE genotype.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 23384, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "SNPs within the 3q28 locus showed association with CSF tau/ptau levels and a range of AD phenotypes including AD risk in the case control dataset, tangle pathology and rate of cognitive decline providing four independent sources of evidence that variants in this region influence risk for AD through a tau-dependent mechanism. Bioinformatic analysis did not reveal any strong putative functional SNP. However, the genes located in this region (GEMC1, OSTN and the non-coding RNA SNAR-I, IL6RAP, UTS2D and CCDC50) are highly expressed in brain and involved in neuronal synaptogenesis. The most significant SNP in this locus and 33 SNPs in LD with rs9877502 are located in transcription factor binding sites and some of these SNPs are also part of a transcription factor matrix (additional information on https://hopecenter.wustl.edu/data/Cruchaga_Neuron_2013), suggesting that rs9877502 or a linked variant could influence the expression of one or more of the genes located in this region. Based on the results of these bioinformatic analyses we performed several gene-expression experiments. IL1RAP showed a nominally significant association with case-control status (P=0.04).

This hypothesis is supported by our recent identification of a rare functional coding variant (TREM2- R47H, rs75932628) in the same locus which substantially increases risk for AD, and is also associated with CSF ptau levels in the present study. Interestingly, the genome-wide significant signal (tagged by rs6922617) is not in LD with rs75932628. Conditional analyses in this region identified another independent SNP (Figure 2, Table 5), located in an intron of TREML2 that is associated with CSF tau and ptau levels. These data suggest that in this region there are at least three independent signals modifying CSF tau levels and risk for AD. Six TREM-family genes (TREM1, TREM2, and TREML1 to TREML4) are located in this region suggesting that several variants in genes with similar function may affect risk for AD in an independent manner. The genome-wide significant SNP in this locus (rs11966476; P = 4.79 x 10-8), is located in a regulatory element and could modify the expression of FOXP4, TREML3, TREML4 or TREM1 (Figure 2). Unfortunately these genes were not included in the GSE15222 dataset and Taqman assays for these genes were out of the dynamic range so we were unsuccessful in analyzing expression levels in brain tissue. Despite this, data from the Allen Brain Atlas suggests that these genes are expressed in the brain. TREM2, was expressed at higher levels in brain tissue from AD cases compared to controls (P = 1.35 x 10-5), as predicted in our previous studies.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 26369, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "For the 9p24.2 locus, we did not observe significant association with risk for AD. This could be because these SNPs affect another aspect of AD such as disease duration or age at onset. Alternatively, these SNPs could affect CSF clearance or protein half-life without affecting risk for AD. If this were the case, we would expect that the same locus would be associated with levels of other CSF proteins. To test this we looked at the association of all of the SNPs identified in this study at the genome-wide significance level with other CSF biomarkers. We did not observe association between these SNPs and CSF levels of either APOE or Abeta, suggesting that these loci are specific for CSF tau levels and are not associated with CSF clearance or protein half life in general. Finally, the lack of association of these loci with AD risk could indicate that the association with this locus is a type I error. The most significant SNPs in this locus are located in intron 7 of GLIS3, a gene which is highly expressed in brain. However, these SNPs (rs514716) are not associated with GLIS3 expression in our relatively small series of brain samples (82 AD cases and 39 non-demented individuals). Both common and rare variants in this gene have been associated with risk for diabetes. There are several studies linking AD with glucose metabolism and diabetes. In fact a meta-analysis combining data from eight studies, observed an association between diabetes mellitus and increased risk for AD (OR: 1.51 95%CI=1.31-1.73) (Bertram et al., Accessed 1/26/2013). In addition our pathway analysis independently identified a diabetes pathway (path:hsa04930, P-value for ptau= 6.60 x 10-03, and tau=8.00 x 10-04, Table S6), because of an enrichment of significant SNPs in MAPK9, IRS2 and MAPK1. Two independent analyses in this study therefore suggest that diabetes-related genes may influence CSF tau and ptau levels, and ultimately risk for AD.

These results suggest that the SNPs identified in this study influence CSF tau/ptau protein levels post-transcriptional mechanism.

These changes are thought to play an important role in tau-related pathogenesis.

The top hit for CSF tau (rs9877502; 3q28) also exhibited association with risk for AD (P = 2.67 x 10-4), tangle pathology (P = 0.01) and global memory decline (P = 4.86 x 10-5). SNPs in the 6q21.1 locus are in the TREM gene cluster close to TREM2, a gene in which a rare variant has recently been reported to substantially increase risk for AD. The other genome-wide significant locus identified in this study did not show association with risk for disease, tangle pathology or memory decline. The lack of association with other AD phenotypes could be because these SNPs have a weaker impact on these phenotypes, or because they affect other aspects of AD, such as disease duration or age at onset. Alternatively, the sample size for the datasets used in the pathology and memory decline studies may not provide enough statistical power.
