As an objective diagnostic test is lacking, diagnoses are based on the occurrence of age-inappropriate impulsive, hyperactive, and inattentive behaviors that occur in multiple settings and cause significant impairment. It is well established that genetic factors explain a large part of the individual differences in the vulnerability for ADHD. The heritability of childhood ADHD and related traits, such as continuous measures of attention problems and hyperactivity, has been estimated at around 75% (see e.g. Kan et al. 2013 and Lichtenstein et al. 2010). Consequently, several studies now aim to identify genetic variants for ADHD. Ten candidate genes show replicated evidence for association according to a recent review. In genome-wide association (GWA) studies, the test of the effects of single genetic variants has not yet yielded genome-wide significant hits, but a gene-enrichment analysis, including single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) showing genome-wide suggestive signals, pointed to several biological pathways involved in neural processes, such as neurodevelopment. Additional evidence for the role of common SNPs (SNPs with a frequency above 5%) in ADHD comes from polygenic analyses in which the joint effect of a large number of SNPs or all SNPs is estimated. All studies but one found that the SNPs explained a significant proportion of the variance, suggesting that associated genetic variants are likely to be detected in larger GWA meta-analyses. This is confirmed by the results from the latest meta-analysis of the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (PGC) ADHD subgroup that yielded several genome-wide significant hits (D Demontis for the PGC ADHD subgroup: presentation 23rd World Congress of Psychiatric Genetics, October 2015, Toronto, CA).", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 3952, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Another recommendation for future gene-finding studies has been to incorporate dimensional approaches of ADHD, such as continuous measures of ADHD symptoms.

The current report describes the first GWA meta-analysis of continuous measures of ADHD in 17,666 children from nine population-based cohorts.

Following Yang et al., we estimated that the PGC ADHD subgroup GWA meta-analysis of 5,621 cases and 13,589 controls had 8% more power than the current study, and yet no significant results were found despite the SNP heritability estimated at 28% in this sample. Several other studies also found evidence for polygenicity of ADHD, with the exception of one study. The range of the SNP heritability estimates for the symptom scores in the current study (Table 2) seems quite large. However, these differences could well be due to chance judging by the large standard errors.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 21651, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The provided evidence for the genetic overlap in continuous and dichotomous measures of ADHD agrees with findings from previous studies with smaller samples. One of these studies also reported that an aggregate polygenic risk score derived from a sample of clinical cases of ADHD predicted preschool parent and school-age parent and teacher ratings of attention problems in a population-based cohort. This indicates common genetic variance across these measures and ages, which is confirmed by the SNP-based heritability of 8% that we calculated based on the results of the meta-analysis. Despite the use of various measures across the cohorts and the accompanying heterogeneity, there remains a signal after combining the results. Overall, it can be concluded that the different instruments assess an underlying common liability for ADHD. Therefore, combining various continuous ADHD measures assessed in the general population with dichotomous diagnosis of ADHD assessed in clinical samples can be a successful way to increase sample size and statistical power for GWA studies. This is supported by preliminary results of the PGC ADHD subgroup (R Walters: presentation 23rd World Congress of Psychiatric Genetics, October 2015, Toronto, CA).", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 22895, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Efforts to decrease heterogeneity across studies by harmonizing phenotypes can result in a further increase in power to detect genetic effects. Behavioral genetic studies have reported that genetic factors are not entirely similar across instruments, raters, and ages. We ran additional SECA analyses to investigate the overlap in results of the current meta-analysis with the results from a GWAS in an independent sample of 727 Australian adolescents whose mothers provided retrospective ratings of their childhood attention skills and problems using the Strengths and Weaknesses of ADHD Symptoms and Normal Behavior Rating Scale (SWAN). These analyses did not show concordance in SNP effects, but we note this could be due to the small size of the Australian sample. Statistical methods like Item Response Theory (IRT) can be used to synchronize different measurement instruments in a sophisticated manner, and have already been successfully applied in a GWA meta-analysis of personality measures. Another way to refine the phenotype when longitudinal data are available is to test the effect of the SNP on a latent variable that reflects stability over time and is more heritable than a measure at a single time point.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 24117, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "To conclude, our results support the notion that ADHD is influenced by genes involved in neuronal development.
