Our aim was to identify new genes and mechanisms causing the co-occurrence of T1D+AITD (APS3v) in the same individual using a genome-wide approach. For our discovery set we analyzed 346 Caucasian APS3v patients and 727 gender and ethnicity matched healthy controls. Genotyping was performed using the Illumina Human660W-Quad.v1. The replication set included 185 APS3v patients and 340 controls. Association analyses were performed using the PLINK program, and pathway analyses were performed using the MAGENTA software. We identified multiple signals within the HLA region and conditioning studies suggested that a few of them contributed independently to the strong association of the HLA locus with APS3v. Outside the HLA region, variants in GPR103, a gene not suggested by previous studies of APS3v, T1D, or AITD, showed genome-wide significance (p<5x10-8). In addition, a locus on 1p13 containing the PTPN22 gene showed genome-wide significant associations. Pathway analysis demonstrated that cell cycle, B-cell development, CD40, and CTLA-4 signaling were the major pathways contributing to the pathogenesis of APS3v.

Interestingly, 4 of the 5 non-MHC genes found to be associated with APS3v in our GWAS (MAGI3, PHTF1, PTPN22, BCL2L15) are located within a 350 Kb region on chromosome 1p13 suggesting that they are all in LD. LD analysis showed that only PHTF1 and PTPN22 are in tight LD (Figure 3B). This suggested that more than one gene in this locus may have an independent effect on the etiology of APS3. However, logistic regression analysis demonstrated that only the PTPN22 gene had an independent effect on disease risk confirming earlier studies showing that PTPN22 is a major autoimmunity gene [;]. These results confirmed our previous studies, using linkage analysis that showed strong linkage of PTPN22 with APS3v [;]. The PTPN22 gene encodes the lymphoid tyrosine phosphatase (LYP) protein, a potent inhibitor of T-cell activation. A non-synonymous SNP causing a tryptophan to arginine change at position 620 has been associated with several autoimmune diseases [;], but the substitution results in gain-of-function and increases suppression of T-cell receptor signaling. It is hypothesized that this substitution may allow escape of self-reactive T-cells from deletion by central tolerance.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 22399, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The GPR103 gene is especially interesting since it is a novel gene-locus identified to be unique for the APS3v phenotype. The GPR103 gene (also designated as QRFPR gene) is a G-protein-coupled receptor that is expressed mostly in brain, but also in human pancreatic islets and it may have an effect on insulin secretion. Moreover, the ligand for GPR103 (P518) is expressed in thyroid cells. Taken together these expression data suggest a role for GPR103 and/or its signaling pathway in APS3v. The GPR103 gene is located on chromosome 4q27 and it has not been previously reported to be associated with autoimmunity. However, a locus on chromosome 4q27 that is approximately 625 Kb downstream the GPR103 gene was previously reported to be associated with T1D, as well as with other autoimmune diseases including rheumatoid arthritis, Celiac disease, and ulcerative colitis. Currently it is unclear whether this is the same locus as the one associated with APS3v, and further studies are needed to explore this possibility.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 23420, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "No previous studies tested the GPR103 locus on 4q27 for association with AITD, and therefore we tested the two GPR103 SNPs showing association with APS3v, for association with AITD in our AITD dataset (251 GD patients, 114 HT patients and 365 matched controls). The analysis showed that SNPs rs1513695 and rs7679475 were both associated with HT (p=0.04 and p=0.02, respectively) but not with GD.

These data show the power of pathway analysis to identify important mechanisms underlying common diseases. Other pathways that were significantly associated with APS3v included cell cycle, B-cell development, CD40 signaling, death receptor signaling, IL12 and IL-2 signaling pathways. The association with CD40 signaling pathway is consistent with previous data showing that CD40 plays a role in the etiology of both AITD and T1D.

Therefore, for both phenotypes, T1D alone and T1D+AITD (APS3v), the MHC region is the most important susceptibility locus. Among non-MHC genes the PTPN22 overlapped between T1D and APS3v, suggesting that some T1D susceptibility genes have a major contribution to the APS3v phenotype, as well. Several genes are specific to the APS3v phenotype. These include the CTLA-4 gene that has been previously shown to be unique for APS3v [;], and the GPR103 gene identified in the current study.
