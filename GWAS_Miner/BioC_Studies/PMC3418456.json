The dementia syndrome associated with advanced infection by HIV, characterized by cognitive impairment, behavioral changes, and progressive central motor abnormalities, was first systematically described and termed AIDS Dementia Complex by. More recently, the term HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder, or HAND, has been established to capture the wide spectrum of HIV-related neurocognitive deficits, ranging from asymptomatic neurocognitive deficits without significant impact on day-to-day functioning, to debilitating dementia. Although the widespread use of combined antiretroviral therapy has resulted in substantial improvements in life expectancy and lowered incidence of dementia, HAND continues to occur with a high prevalence, although mostly in mild forms.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 2984, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The pathogenesis of HAND remains unclear. Evidence suggests that at least the mild and moderate forms of HAND are due to a chronic neuroinflammatory state. Decades of research have led to identification of a widely varying array of cellular and molecular factors associated with HIV-related neuropathology and neurobehavioral dysfunction, yet no reliable biomarkers have been identified. HAND may therefore not be attributable to a single pathogenic process. Instead, HAND may be the behavioral culmination of various pathogenic processes resulting in systemic dysregulation and dysfunction.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 3576, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Searching for the mechanisms of HAND neuropathogenesis, and identifying early indicators and biomarkers of HAND, are central themes of NeuroAIDS research. Currently, several factors are useful for identifying individuals who are inherently or chronically at risk for HAND, including demographic characteristics, medical comorbidities, and lifestyle behaviors, in particular substance abuse. In addition, host genetic factors have received attention, both as a means to identify risk factors and to determine the neuropathogenesis of HAND. To date, only a few genetic susceptibility loci have been identified that alter the risk for HIV-associated dementia or neurocognitive impairment among those with HIV. Importantly, none of the associations between these polymorphisms and HAND-related phenotypes have been consistently replicated. One possible reason for this lack of replication is the use of different neurobehavioral phenotypes across studies. Most used the diagnosis of HIV-associated dementia (HAD) as the phenotype, which is a largely unreliable phenotype due to poor agreement among diagnosticians. A minority has simply averaged all scores from a battery of individual neuropsychological tests to arrive at a composite \"global\" neurocognitive functioning score. The major drawback of these phenotypes, particularly HAD, is that they are complex, influenced by a large number of environmental, psychometric, and other exogenous and endogenous factors. The numerous non-genetic contributors to variance in these measures, including measurement error, makes them less suitable targets for genetic analysis, especially when effect sizes for genetic associations are expected to be low. As it has no known biomarker, HAD is never a definitive diagnosis, but is instead based primarily on exclusion of other etiological possibilities. In making the diagnosis, clinicians differentially weigh demographic, neuropsychological, psychiatric, substance use, medical comorbidites, and neuroimaging data, to name a few. As such, true group membership is never certain. Furthermore, global measures of neurocognitive functioning run the risk of missing domain-specific associations with genes of interest. Therefore, cognitive domain-specific scores (e.g., memory or processing speed) may be more suitable cognitive phenotypes for use in genetic analysis. Composite domain scores (i.e., those arrived at by averaging scores of individual tests that compose that domain) have greater test-retest reliability when compared to individual measures, making them more attractive for creating progression phenotypes. In addition, the use of neurocognitive measures, many of which have demonstrated heritability, offers more precision and a more easily replicable phenotype across studies as compared to diagnostic categories.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 6398, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Ever improving technological advances in genotyping coupled with refinement of phenotype measurement has recently made the application of genome wide association studies (GWAS) potentially fruitful for neuroAIDS. GWAS have identified additional risk variants associated with HIV disease progression, viral set point, rapid progressors, and other disease-related phenotypes, as previously reviewed. Not surprisingly, susceptibility loci identified to date are largely associated with innate and adaptive immunity. In the case of other neurologic conditions, GWAS have recently proven to be valuable, even when the disease examined was already relatively well-characterized. For example, a recent GWAS of late-onset Alzheimer's disease, a neurodegenerative condition with well-established genetic risk factors, recently led to the identification of several new susceptibility loci. In the case of HAND, for which the neuropathogenesis is less understood, GWAS may hold even greater promise. While it is unlikely that one or a few genetic susceptibility loci confer a large proportion of the risk for HAND, the genetic variance explained by GWAS help to achieve an improved mechanistic understanding of the disease. Genes identified through GWAS, even common alleles with weak statistical effects, can provide important information about biological pathways, and ultimately lead to targets for pharmaceutical treatment and prevention.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 7832, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "GWAS require large ethnically homogeneous samples, detailed phenotype information, and tissue or fluid samples that will yield DNA of sufficient quality.

Given our sample size of 1287 men for the analysis of NCI and HAD, we were well powered to detect an OR of at least 2.25 and 3.86, respectively (data not shown). As we did not find significant associations, if genetic variants exist that affect the probability of NCI/HAD in HIV+ men, their individual effect sizes are likely to be less than these ORs. While other GWAS have used even smaller samples and have identified novel SNPs associated with HIV disease related factors, they utilized biological phenotypes that were likely more heritable than those used here. Conversely, HAND (including HAD) is a heterogeneous syndrome likely to have a varied pathogenesis influenced by myriad immunologic, virologic, neurotrophic, and other factors. As such, a sample size considerably larger than the current one may be required to determine the extent to which functional genetic variants in such genes affects risk for HAND.

Perhaps the most unexpected was alcohol use, which had opposite effects on processing speed and executive functioning over time, showing improvement in the former among heavier users and decline in the latter. Most previous studies have found additive or synergistic effects of alcohol use and HIV serostatus upon processing speed. However, these studies generally included heavy drinkers, or stratified their sample based on alcohol use (e.g. light vs. heavy drinkers), whereas we used a continuous measure. Also somewhat surprising, moderate-to-heavy use of cocaine and/or methamphetamines did not have a significant impact on neurocognitive ability over time, although the relationship was in the expected direction. The vast majority of research has demonstrated additive effects of stimulants and HIV, as well as poorer neurocognitive functioning among HIV-infected stimulant users as compared to non-drug using counterparts. One possible explanation for the current findings is that the neurocognitive domains affected by stimulant use in HIV-infected individuals were not adequately sampled in our analysis. Greater degree of depression, as reported on the CES-D, was associated with significant decline in both processing speed and executive functioning. In fact, of all the fixed factors examined, depression had the greatest impact on neurocognitive functioning over time. Higher nadir CD4 was associated with improved performance in both neurocognitive domains. This was expected, as low nadir CD4 has perhaps been the most consistent parameter predictive of neurocognitive impairment and neuropathology in HIV infection. Co-infection with HCV did not have a significant effect on neurocognitive functioning over time. While HCV co-infection has recently been shown in some studies to worsen HIV-related neurocognitive deficits, this has not been examined longitudinally to our knowledge. Here we present, in a longitudinal examination, evidence that co-infection does not hasten neurocognitive decline in the domains assessed. Note however that in our analysis, we created a dichotomous variable for HCV, with seronegative individuals in one group and the other group consisting primarily of individuals with acute or chronic infection, but also some who were clearing (between RNA+ and RNA-) (N=11), cleared (N=34), and with prior infection whose current RNA status was unknown (N=7). There are no guidelines in this somewhat nascent line of inquiry to classify individuals in these later groups as HCV+ or HCV-, as one could argue that even in cleared individuals, the neuropathological consequences of co-infection may be lasting. Finally, the impact of ARV regimen on neurocognitive functioning over time was revealing. Use of monotherapy was associated with decreased processing speed performance over time, as compared to no therapy. However, it did not impact executive functioning. Conversely, use of combination/potent therapy, a modality initiated in the early 1990s, was not associated with processing speed but was associated with improved performance on measures of executive functioning relative to no ARV therapy. The relationship between ARV regimen and neurocognition is complex; early treatments were used primarily for seriously ill patients, while later treatments were more likely to be initiated based on immune system functioning rather than general systemic health. Also, long term use of some ARV regimens (particularly early monotherapies) may be neurotoxic despite eradicating the virus from the brain. A recent classification scheme to estimate the efficacy of individual ARVs in the CNS will help in further clarifying this relationship.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 42362, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The current findings should be interpreted with the following additional caveats. Firstly, this was a convenience sample, and therefore not all variables were operationalized and measured in an ideal fashion. In addition, the MACS participants chosen for genotyping belonged to specific subgroups of infected individuals, including seroconverters and those with varying levels of disease progression. As such, this sample may not be representative of the general HIV+ population. Secondly, as described above, some variables, such as HCV infection and ARV use, were collapsed into a simpler variable, thereby pooling individuals with widely varying degrees of infection or different ARV regimens into the same group. Finally, we have acknowledged that the very small sample size likely impacted our ability to detect true associations. HAND is a heterogeneous syndrome likely to have a varied pathogenesis influenced by myriad immunologic, virologic, neurotrophic, and other factors. As such, a sample size considerably larger than the current one would be required to determine the extent to which functional genetic variants in such genes affects risk for HAND. We are optimistic that as more HIV cohorts undergo genome-wide genotyping, larger studies will be possible. Alternatively, a more robust biological phenotype for HAND could be the focus of future studies. While none have been identified thus far that demonstrate adequate reliability for diagnostic purposes, efforts are underway to identify CSF, plasma, and neuroimaging, biomarkers of HAND. In addition, genetic association studies that focus on neuropathological phenotypes may be useful in identifying which neuropathological changes, if any, underlie HAND. Only one such study has been reported to date, with negative findings.
