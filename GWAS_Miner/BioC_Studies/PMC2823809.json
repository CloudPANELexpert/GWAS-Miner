With the fifth highest incidence amongst all cancers in the U.S., the annual incidence of NHL has doubled since the 1970s. With the increasing evidence supporting the importance of genetic determinants in lymphomagenesis, there is a strong impetus to identify genetic risk factors. Epidemiological and biological evidence suggest that environmental and genetic risk factors differ for the common NHL subtypes, follicular (FL), diffuse large B-cell (DLBCL) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)/small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL). We therefore conducted genome-wide association studies (GWAS) using separate DNA pools from 189 FL, 221 DLBCL, and 148 CLL/SLL cases and 592 controls (NC1 sample set) from a larger San Francisco Bay Area NHL case-control study to identify subtype-specific NHL susceptibility genes (for study design see Supplementary Fig. 1; for description of study populations see Supplementary Table 1).
