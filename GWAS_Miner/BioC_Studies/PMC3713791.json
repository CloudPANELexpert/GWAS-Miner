These associations between rs6795970 and atrial fibrillation and cardiac arrhythmias were also seen specifically in the original \"heart healthy\" study population, and were independent of the SNP's association with QRS duration.

Importantly, the selection logic for the case selection algorithm in our GWAS required the absence of cardiovascular disease at the time of the ECG.

In addition, a genetic disease caused by SCN5A loss-of-function mutations (Brugada Syndrome) is characterized by slowed ventricular conduction and an increased risk for fatal arrhythmias. Interestingly, previous analyses of variable PR duration have also identified strong associations with variants in SCN10A, and multiple mechanisms are currently being examined to explain this effect: expression of SCN10A-encoded channels in cardiomyocytes and/or cardiac neurons, or regulation of SCN5A-10A expression.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 24294, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Our PheWAS analysis suggests that SCN10A, SCN5A, and EXOG variants are associated with a cardiac arrhythmia billing codes (entered either by physicians or professional coders); this includes atrial fibrillation and flutter, supraventricular and ventricular tachycardia, cardiac arrest, and other unspecified arrhythmias.

Chambers et al. previously demonstrated associations between SCN10A rs6795970 and heart block and ventricular fibrillation; we also noted an association with first-degree atrioventricular block (p=0.009, Supplementary Table 2). Mouse studies have demonstrated expression of Nav1.8 in vagal and spinal afferents in gastrointestinal mucosa and myenteric plexes, and interestingly SCN10A was also associated with cholecystitis in the PheWAS. Variants in CDKN1A and C6orf204, however, were not associated with cardiac arrhythmias, although we cannot exclude that weak associations may exist. In contrast, the C6orf204 locus seems most associated with neoplastic disorders (colorectal cancer, prostatic hypertrophy, and melanoma); its strongest cardiovascular disease association was atherosclerosis (odds ratio 1.094, p=0.03).

One of the key lessons in the eMERGE experience to date has been that algorithms to identify cases and controls for genomic or other study can be successfully deployed across multiple EMR systems.

Slow conduction may promote reentrant arrhythmias. We identified 5,272 individuals with normal ECGs and no evidence of cardiac disease from electronic medical records at five institutions and performed genome-wide association analysis. We found variants in 5 loci associated with QRS duration in normal individuals, including SCN5A, SCN10A, NFIA, near CDKN1A, and near SLC35F1 that were replicated in the CHARGE consortium QRS meta-analysis. Subsequently, we performed phenome-wide association studies on associated SNPs.
