Pazopanib is an oral angiogenesis inhibitor that blocks signaling by vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2) and other kinases, and has been approved for commercial use to treat renal cell carcinoma and soft-tissue sarcoma. VEGFR2 is a transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinase expressed by endothelial cells, subpopulations of bone marrow-derived cells, and some tumor cells. It is the primary transducer of extracellular VEGF mediating endothelial cell proliferation, migration, and resistance to apoptosis. Alternate splicing of KDR, the gene that encodes VEGFR2, results in a 679 amino acid truncated extracellular domain product which is soluble and circulates in blood (sVEGFR2). VEGFR2 kinase inhibitors decrease serum concentrations sVEGFR2 [sVEGFR2], and these concentrations return to baseline after cessation of drug administration.

In rodents, the magnitude of these drug-related changes in [sVEGFR2] is dose-dependent and independent of the presence of tumors.

The most significant of these other SNPs was rs10050046 located 56kb from rs34231037. The minor allele C has frequency 0.37 and was associated with decreased levels of [sVEGFR2] (0.53 ng/mL per allele; p = 3.0 x10-11), less than 1/3 the magnitude of effect of rs34231037. In the primary GWAS there was marginal association between rs10050046 and [sVEGFR2] (p = 10-3). The LD between rs10050046 and rs34231037 is r2=0.04 and |D'|=0.8 suggesting that the two [sVEGFR2]-lowering alleles act independently in the Amish. However, rs10050046 was not associated with serum [sVEGFR2] in either of the cancer cohorts (-0.04 ng/mL, p = 0.88 in the study 2 cohort, and 0.09 ng/mL, p= 0.67 in the study 3 cohort).", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 21650, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "Discussion", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 21661, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "We performed a genome-wide association study of a serum peptide in the Amish to discover a SNP with reproducible effects on that peptide in cancer patients.

As in genetic studies, for example of grasshopper body size and human schizophreniform behavior, we employed the approach of endophenotyping to the discovery of a novel cancer pharmacogenetic biomarker. In a step-wise approach, we first characterized the repeatability, interindividual variance, and heritability of [sVEGFR2] as an endophenotype for response to VEGFR2 kinase inhibitors. Second, we performed an agnostic GWAS in a healthy population and identified rs34231037/C482R in KDR, the gene encoding the VEGFR2 protein, to be associated with [sVEGFR2]. Third, we replicated these findings in two cancer populations.

The amino acid is located in the extracellular Ig-like domain V, distant from the VEGF ligand binding site. Recombinant cell transfection studies revealed no differences in VEGF-induced phosphorylation or expression of VEGFR2. However, the substitution of arginine for cysteine diminished formation of complexes by VEGFR2 with beta1 integrin and the integrin receptor-like protein TEM8. This complex was associated with VEGFR2-mediated activation of VEGFR1 transcription and protein expression. With less VEGFR1 expression, endothelial cells demonstrate greater sensitivity to activation of VEGFR2 signaling by VEGF binding.

"text": "Germ-line genetic variation can play an important role in the course of cancer and treatment responses. Conventional strategies for discovering germ-line factors in disease and therapeutic responses in other health conditions can be challenging to apply to cancer pharmacogenomics research. We employed a step-wise approach of studying a reproducibly measurable serum protein, sVEGFR2, in a population of volunteers who did not have cancer, to identify a genetic variant (rs34231037/C482R) as a marker for response to VEGFR2 kinase inhibitors. The association of rs34231037 with serum concentrations of sVEGFR2 [sVEGFR2] was replicated first in unrelated cancer patients. In a separate cohort of renal cancer patients, the uncommon gene variant was associated with lower baseline [sVEGFR2] measures and carriers experienced greater decline in [sVEGFR2] over 4 weeks of pazopanib exposure compared to non-carriers. We expect this genetic marker might have a clinically significant effect on treatment outcomes with VEGFR2 kinase inhibitors.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}], "annotations": [], "relations": []}]}
