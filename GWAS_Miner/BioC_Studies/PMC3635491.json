A random-effects analysis of the discovery sample, conducted to examine heterogeneity between cohorts, reduced significance only slightly for rs7294919 (P = 4.43 x 10-7) compared to the primary fixed-effects analysis (P = 2.42 x 10-7). The association was consistent, although stronger, in the full sample compared to the healthy subset (Fig. 2). Notably, the association was robust to the effects of head and brain size (Fig. 2), and the locus was not significantly associated with intracranial volume (P = 0.54) or total brain volume (P = 0.41). This suggests an effect at the level of the hippocampus rather than on brain size in general. The direction of the effect was consistent across samples and ages (Fig. 1). Haplotype analysis of directly genotyped variants near rs7294919 in two samples confirmed that the association was present across the haplotype and that the causal variant was well marked by rs7294919 (Supplementary Note). rs7294919 was also significantly associated with hippocampal volume in the cohorts from the CHARGE Consortium, which are composed of elderly subjects.

To determine whether the observed association is related to a regulatory mechanism, we examined potential cis effects of this variant on expression levels of genes within a 1-Mb region. In temporal lobe tissue resected from 71 individuals with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy and hippocampal sclerosis in the University College London (UCL) epilepsy cohort, we examined association between rs4767492 (a proxy for rs7294919, which was not directly genotyped; r2 = 0.636 in 1000 Genomes Project Phase 1) and expression levels. This analysis suggested an association (P = 0.006, controlling for age) with expression of the TESC gene, which lies 3' to FBXW8 (149 kb; Fig. 3). To corroborate this finding, we used the publicly available SNPExpress database (see URLs), which includes data on gene expression in post-mortem frontal cortex from 93 subjects. In this independent sample, expression levels of TESC again significantly differed by genotype (rs4767492; P = 0.0021). Additional replication came from the UK Brain Expression Database, where TESC expression in post-mortem brain tissues from 134 individuals free from neurological disorders showed a strong difference by genotype in temporal cortex (rs7294919; P = 9.7 x 10-4 for gene and 4.8 x 10-5 for exon 8). Given the small sample sizes and low minor allele frequency of this SNP (MAF = 0.099), no homozygotes for the minor allele were observed in any brain tissue sample, limiting the inferences we can draw regarding mode of action.

TESC also has moderate expression in the human hippocampus during adulthood (Allen Institute Brain Atlas, see URLs; Fig. 3). Its protein product, tescalcin, interacts with the Na+/H+ exchanger (NHE1), which is involved in the regulation of intracellular pH, cell volume and cytoskeletal organization.

This locus was associated with intracranial volume across lifespan, as shown by the strong replication in samples from healthy elderly individuals in the CHARGE Consortium. The combined analysis resulted in the identification of a highly significant association (P = 1.12 x 10-12). Of note, rs10784502 has been reliably associated with increased adult height (P = 3.636 x 10-32; effect allele: C). The genetic correlation between height and intracranial volume within the QTIM sample was significant (rg = 0.31; P = 1.34 x 10-7), as was that observed in the GOBS sample (rg = 0.20; P = 0.026), suggesting modest overlap of shared genetic determinants. rs10784502 also had an effect on total brain volume in the discovery sample (P = 9.49 x 10-5). When considering the results from the intracranial volume meta-analysis in SNPs previously associated with height (NSNPs = 175; Supplementary Fig. 41), a clear inflation of the test statistic was observed (lambda = 1.44), indicating that SNPs associated with height are also associated with intracranial volume. This enrichment, which was not observed for hippocampal volume (Supplementary Figs. 42 and 43), was due to a systematically higher degree of association throughout the candidate SNP set rather than a small number of large effects. Structural equation modeling showed that the effect of rs10784502 on intracranial volume could not completely be accounted for by the indirect effects of this SNP on height or by the correlation between height and intracranial volume (Supplementary Fig. 44).", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 12820, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Examining correlations between rs10784502 and expression levels of genes within a 1-Mb region, we identified a significant effect on the expression of HMGA2 (P = 0.0077) as the single significant result in the GOBS transcriptional profile data. Additionally, HMGA2 expression levels in PBMCs were significantly negatively genetically correlated with intracranial volume (rg = -0.49; P = 0.016) in this cohort. These results support HMGA2 as a positional candidate gene underlying our observed QTL. HMGA2 encodes the high-mobility group AT-hook 2 protein, which is a chromatin-associated protein that regulates stem cell renewal during development. It is implicated in human growth through genetic association studies and the presence of rare mutations and also has known roles in neural precursor cells.
