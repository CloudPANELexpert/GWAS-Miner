The overall annual VTE incidence among USA whites is 108 per 100,000 person-years; incidence rates increase exponentially with age for both men and women, and for both DVT and PE. For almost one-quarter of PE patients, the initial clinical presentation is sudden death. Family and twin studies suggest that VTE is highly heritable (h2=0.62) and likely results from multigenic action as well as environmental exposures. Several genetic disorders or mutations that affect the regulation of hemostasis have been associated with VTE in small case-control studies or observed in high VTE-risk pedigrees. These include mutations that impair the anticoagulant pathway, up-regulate (e.g., prothrombin G20210A) or impair downregulation of the procoagulant pathway (e.g., Factor V Leiden), downregulate fibrinolysis, and up-regulate innate immunity. In a SNP-based candidate gene, case-control study, we tested genetic variation within all known important components of the anticoagulant, procoagulant, fibrinolytic and innate immunity pathways for an independent association with VTE and found one or more SNPs within ABO, F2, F5, F11, KLKB1, SELP and SCUBE1 were significantly associated with VTE, including Factor V Leiden (F5 rs6025 T [minor] allele), prothrombin G20210A, ABO non-O blood type (ABO rs8176719, odds ratio [OR]=1.47, P=5.68x10-12), and a novel association with ABO rs2519093 (OR=1.68, P=8.08x10-16) that was independent of blood type. A GWAS confirmed associations of VTE with Factor V Leiden and with ABO loci (blood groups non-O and A2), and a second GWAS with a larger sample size and more dense genome-wide scan genotype data found associations of VTE with the F11 and FGG loci. We hypothesized that genes within other pathways also are VTE disease-susceptibility genes. To test this hypothesis, we performed a genome-wide association study on the same VTE case-control (discovery) population used for our candidate gene study, and replicated all SNPs exceeding genome-wide significance in a separate VTE case-control (replication) population.
