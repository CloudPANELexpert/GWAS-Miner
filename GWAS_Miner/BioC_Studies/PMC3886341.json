Analysis of individual SNP associations revealed only one marker-component phenotype association, between rs1868152 and Illicit Drugs, with a p-value below the standard genome-wide threshold of 5 x 10-8. Because we had analyzed five separate phenotypes, we do not consider this single association to be significant. However, we report 13 SNPs that were associated at p < 10-5 for one phenotype and p < 10-3 for at least one other phenotype, which are potential candidates for future investigations of variants associated with general behavioral disinhibition. Biometric analysis of the twin and family data yielded estimates of additive heritability for the component phenotypes ranging from 49% to 70%, GCTA estimates of heritability for the same phenotypes ranged from 8% to 37%.

Behavioral disinhibition is a higher-level dimensional construct, which has as its core feature the inability to regulate immediate response inclinations at the expense of long-term gains or losses. There is a substantial and consistent research literature showing that individuals high in behavioral disinibition are at elevated risk for developing a broad array of behavioral disorders including substance use disorders, externalizing disorders of both childhood (e.g., attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder) and adulthood (e.g., antisocial personality disorder), and personality markers of impulsivity or sensation seeking. Behavioral disinhibition is, consequently, hypothesized to represent a higher-level trait that accounts for the substantial comorbidity that exists among substance use disorders and between substance use disorders and externalizing disorders. Importantly for the research reported here, the familial transmission of behavioral disinhibition disorders appears to owe largely to the transmission of generalized risk; there is limited evidence of disorder-specific familial transmission. Moreover, twin studies find that most of the genetic influences on individual behavioral disinhibition disorders can be attributed to genetic influences at the general factor level, with estimates of the heritability of the behavioral disinhibition ranging from 60-80%.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 4128, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Candidate-gene studies also support the existence of common genetic influences on multiple indicators of behavioral inhibition.

Nonetheless, our failure to find associations between our nicotine phenotype and variants in the cholinergic nicotinic receptor subunit gene clusters on 15q25.1 (CHRNA5-CHRNA3-CHRNB4) and 8p11 (CHRNB3-CHRNA6) as well as nicotine-metabolizing enzyme genes on 19q13 (CYP2A6-CYP2B6) may seem a bit surprising since these variants have been identified in earlier GWAS of smoking.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 26190, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "We believe several factors may have contributed to our failure to replicate SNP associations identified in earlier meta-analyses of smoking data. First, and we think most significant, our nicotine phenotype is defined differently from how smoking was defined in these previous studies. Specifically, earlier studies implemented an exposure screen for having smoked at least 100 cigarettes in a lifetime before being considered a non-smoking control. In this way, they ensured that everyone in the sample would have had sufficient exposure to nicotine to have had an opportunity to develop a regular smoking habit. We applied no similar screen because exposure to nicotine is by itself an indicator of behavioral disinhibition and we did not want to eliminate from the analysis individuals who had smoked fewer than 100 cigarettes as these individuals may be especially low on the behavioral disinhibition dimension. Second, in studies that have found significant SNP associations with smoking, the sample size has been substantially larger than the size of the sample in this study. For example, the ENGAGE consortium includes more than 30,000 genotyped participants for each of their smoking phenotypes. While we were unable here to detect the effect of individual SNP associations, we are able to detect the aggregate effect of multiple SNPs. Specifically, in a previous analysis with a subset of the sample used here, we found a significant association of smoking (in current smokers) with an aggregated score based on 92 SNPs identified in a previous meta-analysis of smoking.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 27771, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "One of the unique features of our sample is that it includes observations in two distinct generations, parents (who were middle-age at the time of assessment) and their offspring (who were between 16 and 21). One might expect that the mean levels of each of the five behavioral disinhibition phenotypes would vary between the parent and offspring generations. Consistent with this expectation, generation had a large covariate effect in the RFGLS analysis. Of greater significance in the present analysis, however, is whether any SNP effects varied across the generations. In order to account for this possibility, we included a SNP by generation interaction term in the regression models and found little evidence for differential effects. Moreover, biometric analysis of the familial data suggested that while collateral first-degree relatives (i.e., biological siblings, dizygotic twins) were consistently more similar than intergenerational relatives (i.e., parents and their offspring), this increased similarity could be attributed to greater environmental similarity among sibling as compared to parent-offspring pairs (i.e., to shared environmental effects). The pattern of familial correlations is consistent with heritable factors having a similar phenotypic effect across the two generations. Nonetheless, whether SNP effects for behavioral phenotypes vary by age is a distinct possibility supported by the observation that the heritability of many behavioral traits increases with age, at least between adolescence and early adulthood. Indeed, in the previously mentioned study where we looked at the association of smoking with the aggregate effect of 92 SNPs, we found that the resulting SNP score was significantly associated with smoking at ages 20 and 24 but not at ages 14 and 17. The developmentally contingent nature of genetic effects for behavioral phenotypes is a major research question that will undoubtedly be a focus of future research in this area.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 29748, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "A second unique feature of our sample is that the family structure of the data allows us to estimate heritability using both biometric as well as GCTA methods. The comparison of the two sets of heritability estimates can be informative in terms of the missing heritability problem. Specifically, GCTA estimates the extent to which additive genetic effects captured by variants included on the GWAS array account for phenotypic differences. In principle, GCTA estimates the magnitude of heritable variance detectable from markers from the genotype array when statistical power is perfect (i.e., sample size is infinite). Alternatively, biometric estimates of heritability index all additive genetic effects, regardless of whether they are captured by the SNP array. GCTA estimates for height and general intelligence indicate that somewhat more than half the heritable variance for these traits can be accounted for by common SNPs. GCTA estimates for personality and schizophrenia suggest that less than half the heritable variance is being accounted for. In our case, for only one phenotype (Illicit Drugs) was the GCTA estimate (.37) at least 50% of the biometric estimate (.55). For the other phenotypes, the GCTA estimate ranged from 40% of the biometric estimate (for Behavioral Disinhibition) to only 11% of the estimate for Alcohol Dependence. While it is important to emphasize that the confidence intervals associated with the GCTA estimates are broad, these findings when combined with previous results for schizophrenia and personality suggest that much of the heritable variation for some behavioral phenotypes cannot be captured by common SNPs.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 31405, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "In summary, we undertook a GWAS analysis of multiple indicators of behavioral disinhibition using more than 500K SNPs in a sample of over 7000 individuals of European ancestry. While we failed to find any confirmed associations that satisfy the recognized standard for declaring genomewide significance, consistent association findings were observed for several SNPs across the multiple indicators. These markers may be worthy of future investigation. A comparison of biometric and GCTA estimates of heritability for the five clinical phenotypes further suggests that the genetic architecture of the five clinical phenotypes is complex and that much of the heritable effects may not be accounted for by common SNPs.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 32121, "infons": {"section_type": "SUPPL", "type": "title_1"}, "text":
