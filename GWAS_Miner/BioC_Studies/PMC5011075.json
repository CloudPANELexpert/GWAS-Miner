We derived credible sets of variants mapping within 500 kb of the lead SNP at each locus that together account for 99% of the posterior probability (piC) of driving the association signal (Table S9). Smaller credible sets, in terms of the number of SNPs they contain, or the genomic interval that they cover, thus correspond to more precise fine-mapping.

The closest RGS14 ortholog in Drosophila melanogaster is loco, for which reduced expression is associated with longer lifespan and stress resistance. We thus conducted experiments aimed at characterizing a role for loco loss-of-function variants in salt sensitivity. We compared survival of two independently derived heterozygous loco mutants (y1w1; locod06164/+ and y1w1; locoEY-P283/+) with isogenic y1w1 controls after supplementing their diet with varying NaCl concentrations for 8 days (Figure 2).

However, we observed significantly improved survival of the heterozygous loco mutants over controls on NaCl-supplemented food (Figure 2, Table S14), thereby indicating a role for this gene in resistance to salt stress. To exclude the effects of inbreeding depression on our findings, we also repeated our experiments with the same strains on a heterogenic background.

Although salt sensitivity has not been directly correlated with variation in eGFR in humans, it has been associated with albuminuria, elevated creatinine, and the subsequent development of hypertension, suggesting the relevance of this trait to kidney function. Indeed, in animal models, salt sensitivity is tightly linked with a blunted tubuloglomerular feedback (TGF) or impaired increase in GFR after salt loading. Consistent with this, we demonstrated that renal mRNA expression of Nfatc1 and Rgs14 in a salt-sensitive mouse model was reduced after exposure to a high-salt diet and induced CKD. In parallel with the findings in Drosophila melanogaster, these results are consistent with the hypothesis that the capacity to reduce expression of Rgs14 and Nfatc1 determines the extent of the response to stress. Another possible mechanism suggested by our results in Drosophila is a role for oxidative stress, to which RGS14 ortholog mutants are resistant, and which has been implicated in mammalian salt sensitivity.
